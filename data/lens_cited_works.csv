T. Willats,"Phage display is a molecular technique by which foreign proteins are expressed at the surface of phage particles. Such phage thereby become vehicles for expression that not only carry within them the nucleotide sequence encoding expressed proteins, but also have the capacity to replicate. Using phage display vast numbers of variant nucleotide sequences may be converted into populations of variant peptides and proteins which may be screened for desired properties. It is now some seventeen years since the first demonstration of the feasibility of this technology and the intervening years have seen an explosion in its applications. This review discusses the major uses of phage display including its use for elucidating protein interactions, molecular evolution and for the production of recombinant antibodies.",50,"Antibodies/genetics; Bacteriophages/genetics; Cloning, Molecular; Gene Library; Plant Proteins/genetics; Protein Binding",Antibodies; Plant Proteins,http://pubmed.cn/12516857 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021215516430 https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12516857,34,12516857,10.1023/a:1021215516430,1519734172,

Promoters recognized by major and minor forms of RNA polymerase holoenzymes are compared for their specificities and differences. Both natural and hybrid promoters that have been constructed for purposes of efficient and regulated transcription are discussed in terms of their utility. Since promoter regions contain sequences that are recognized not only by RNA polymerase but by positive and negative regulatory factors that regulate expression from promoters, the functions and properties of these promoter regions are also described.

Roider; Martin Vingron,"Recent experimental and theoretical efforts have highlighted the fact that binding of transcription factors to DNA can be more accurately described by continuous measures of their binding affinities, rather than a discrete description in terms of binding sites. While the binding affinities can be predicted from a physical model, it is often desirable to know the distribution of binding affinities for specific sequence backgrounds. In this paper, we present a statistical approach to derive the exact distribution for sequence models with fixed GC content. We demonstrate that the affinity distribution of almost all known transcription factors can be effectively parametrized by a class of generalized extreme value distributions. Moreover, this parameterization also describes the affinity distribution for sequence backgrounds with variable GC content, such as human promoter sequences. Our approach is applicable to arbitrary sequences and all transcription factors with known binding preferences that can be described in terms of a motif matrix. The statistical treatment also provides a proper framework to directly compare transcription factors with very different affinity distributions. This is illustrated by our analysis of human promoters with known binding sites, for many of which we could identify the known regulators as those with the highest affinity. The combination of physical model and statistical normalization provides a quantitative measure which ranks transcription factors for a given sequence, and which can be compared directly with large-scale binding data. Its successful application to human promoter sequences serves as an encouraging example of how the method can be applied to other sequences.",4,"Algorithms; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Computer Simulation; DNA/genetics; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Models, Genetic; Models, Statistical; Molecular Sequence Data; Protein Binding; Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional/genetics; Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods; Transcription Factors/genetics",Transcription Factors; DNA,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/18369429 http://qa-pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1584573 http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000039 http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000039 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2266803 http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000039 http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1584573 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000039 https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_1584573 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18369429 http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1584573/component/escidoc:1584572/journal.pcbi.1000039.pdf,2,18369429,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000039,1975420528,

We find that the LTR directs relatively high levels of CAT synthesis within 48 hr after calcium phosphate-mediated introduction of this plasmid into CV-1 monkey kidney cells, chicken embryo fibroblasts, Chinese hamster ovary cells, HeLa cells, or mouse NIH/3T3 cells. The level of CAT synthesis is 3-fold higher in CV-1 cells and up to 10-fold higher in HeLa and mouse NIH/3T3 cells than after transfection with a related vector, pSV2cat, carrying CAT sequences under control of the simian virus 40 early promoter. We have shown, by primer extension, that the amounts of CAT-specific mRNAs encoded by pRSVcat and pSV2cat correlate with the levels of CAT enzyme activity. By both S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension, we have demonstrated that the start site for RNA transcription within the LTR of pRSVcat corresponds to previous mapping data. We estimated transfection efficiencies by monitoring immunofluorescence induced by a rhodamine-labeled CAT antibody. Our results indicate that the Rous sarcoma virus LTR can direct synthesis of high levels of functional mRNA and has a wide expression range. The observed high transcriptional activity of the LTR is significant because it has been postulated that this LTR promotes activity of adjacent cellular oncogenes.",79,"Acetyltransferases/genetics; Animals; Avian Sarcoma Viruses/genetics; Cell Transformation, Viral; Chick Embryo; Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase; DNA Restriction Enzymes; DNA, Viral/genetics; Endonucleases; Fibroblasts; Genes, Viral; Kinetics; Operon; Plasmids; RNA, Viral/genetics; Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases; Transfection","DNA, Viral; RNA, Viral; Acetyltransferases; Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase; Endonucleases; DNA Restriction Enzymes; Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases",http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/6294651 http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1982PNAS...79.6777G http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC347216 http://www.pnas.org/content/79/22/6777.short https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC347216/,380,6294651,10.1073/pnas.79.22.6777,2010356985,PMC347216

The resulting replicative plasmids, referred to as pTHAAD (aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase) and pTHBUT (butyrate operon), were used to complement C. acetobutylicum mutant strains, in which genes encoding aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (aad) or butyrate kinase (buk) had been inactivated by recombination with Emr constructs. Complementation of strain PJC4BK (buk mutant) with pTHBUT restored butyrate kinase activity and butyrate production during exponential growth. Complementation of strain PJC4AAD (aad mutant) with pTHAAD restored NAD(H)-dependent butanol dehydrogenase activity, NAD(H)-dependent butyraldehyde dehydrogenase activity and butanol production during solventogenic growth. The development of an alternative selectable marker makes it is possible to overexpress genes, via replicative plasmids, in mutant strains that lack specific enzyme activities, thereby expanding the number of possible genetic manipulations that can be performed in C. acetobutylicum.

An important question is whether cancer cells also contain a large number of random mutations, i.e., randomly distributed unselected mutations that occur in only one or a few cells of a tumor. Such random mutations could contribute to the morphologic and functional heterogeneity of cancers and include mutations that confer resistance to therapy. We have postulated that malignant cells exhibit a mutator phenotype resulting in the generation of random mutations throughout the genome. We have recently developed an assay to quantify random mutations in human tissue with unprecedented sensitivity. Here, we report measurements of random single-nucleotide substitutions in normal and neoplastic human tissues. In normal tissues, the frequency of spontaneous random mutations is exceedingly low, less than 1 × 10−8 per base pair. In contrast, tumors from the same individuals exhibited an average frequency of 210 × 10−8 per base pair, an elevation of at least two orders of magnitude. Our data document tumor heterogeneity at the single-nucleotide level, indicate that accelerated mutagenesis prevails late into tumor progression, and suggest that elevation of random mutation frequency in tumors might serve as a novel prognostic indicator.",103,"DNA, Single-Stranded/genetics; Gene Expression/genetics; Humans; Mutation/genetics; Neoplasms/genetics; Phenotype","DNA, Single-Stranded",http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006PNAS..10318238B http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1636340 http://www.pnas.org/content/103/48/18238.full https://cwru.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/human-cancers-express-a-mutator-phenotype-2 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2185406 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17108085 http://depts.washington.edu/loeblabs/pdf/2006_Bielas.pdf http://www.pnas.org/content/103/48/18238.full.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Keith_Loeb/publication/6689844_From_the_Cover_Human_cancers_express_a_mutator_phenotype/links/00b49528e6bc0f2837000000.pdf,4,17108085,10.1073/pnas.0607057103,2063728375,

This development started with the notion that immunoglobulins owe their function to the composition of a conserved framework region and a spatially well-defined antigen-binding site made of peptide segments that are hypervariable both in sequence and in conformation. After the application of antibody engineering methods along with library techniques had resulted in first successes in the selection of functional antibody fragments, several laboratories began to exploit other types of protein architectures for the construction of practically useful binding proteins. Properties like small size of the receptor protein, stability and ease of production were the focus of this work. Hence, among others, single domains of antibodies or of the immunoglobulin superfamily, protease inhibitors, helix-bundle proteins, disulphide-knotted peptides and lipocalins were investigated. Recently, the scaffold concept has even been adopted for the construction of enzymes. However, it appears that not all kinds of polypeptide fold which may appear attractive for the engineering of loop regions at a first glance will indeed permit the construction of independent ligand-binding sites with high affinities and specificities. This review will therefore concentrate on the critical description of the structural properties of experimentally tested protein scaffolds and of the novel functions that have been achieved on their basis, rather than on the methodology of how to best select a particular mutant with a certain activity. An overview will be provided about the current approaches, and some emerging trends will be identified.

Here, we investigated the production of primary and secondary metabolites in S. cerevisiae strains where the glycerol production pathway was inactivated through deletion of the two glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenases genes (GPD1/GPD2) and replaced with alternative NAD+-generating pathways. While these modifications decreased fermentative ability compared to the wild-type strain, all improved growth and/or fermentative ability of the gpd1Δgpd2Δ strain in self-generated anaerobic high sugar medium. The partial NAD+ regeneration ability of the mutants resulted in significant amounts of alternative products, but at lower yields than glycerol. Compared to the wild-type strain, pyruvate production increased in most genetically manipulated strains, whereas acetate and succinate production decreased in all strains. Malate production was similar in all strains. Isobutanol production increased substantially in all genetically manipulated strains compared to the wild-type strain, whereas only mutant strains expressing the sorbitol producing SOR1 and srlD genes showed increases in isoamyl alcohol and 2-phenyl alcohol. A marked reduction in ethyl acetate concentration was observed in the genetically manipulated strains, while isobutyric acid increased.

The enzymes had different molecular masses (52 and 65 kDa, SDS-PAGE data) but the same pI (4.5). Peptide sequencing showed that a single gene encodes both proteins. Both enzymes displayed maximum activity at pH 5.0-5.5; they had similar specific activities against soluble substrates. However, the 65 kDa CBH I was much more efficient in hydrolysis of Avicel and cotton cellulose, and its adsorption ability on Avicel was notably higher in comparison to the 52 kDa enzyme. Using the in-gel tryptic digestion followed by MALDI-TOF mass-spectrometry, it was shown that the 52 kDa enzyme represents the core catalytic module of the intact 65 kDa CBH I without a cellulose-binding module and major part of glycosylated linker. Both enzymes were stable at 50°C for 24 h. At higher temperature, the 65 kDa enzyme showed better thermostability: it retained >90% of activity after 7 h at 60°C and 50% of activity after 3 h at 65°C. The intact CBH I is also notably more thermostable than the Trichoderma reesei CBH I (by 6°C, the data of differential scanning microcalorimetry study). The cbh1 gene was cloned and then the amino acid sequence of Cel7A was deduced from the gene sequence.

Urwin; Michael J. McPherson; Howard J. Atkinson,"Plant defence strategies usually involve the action of several gene products. Transgenic resistance strategies are likely to have enhanced efficacy when they involve more than one transgene. Here we explore possible mechanisms for the co-delivery of multiple effectors via a single transgene. As an example we report the co-delivery of two distinct proteinase inhibitors in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. to examine resistance against plant parasitic nematodes. A cysteine and serine proteinase inhibitor have been joined as translational fusions by one of two peptide linkers. One linker, part of the spacer region of a plant metallothionein-like protein (PsMTa), was selected to be cleaved in planta. A second linker, derived from the fungal enzyme galactose oxidase (GO) was chosen to be refractory to cleavage in planta. Western blot analysis of cell extracts confirmed the expected pattern of predominantly single inhibitors derived from the PsMTa construct and a primarily dual inhibitor from the GO construct. Analysis of cyst and root-knot nematodes recovered from transgenic Arabidopsis expressing inhibitors as single or dual molecules revealed the uptake of inhibitors with the exception of those linked by the PsMTa linker. This unexpected result may be due to residues of the PsMTa linker interacting with cell membranes. Despite lack of ingestion, PsMTa-linked cowpea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI) affected the sexual development of the cyst nematodes, indicating an external site of action. The engineered cystatin (Oc-IΔD86) component from the PsMTa constuct had no effect, indicating that ingestion is necessary for the cystatin to be effective. The delivery of dual inhibitors linked by the GO linker showed a clear additive effect over either inhibitor delivered singly. The application of this technology to other plant pathogens is discussed.",204,"Animals; Arabidopsis/immunology; Body Constitution; Cystatins/genetics; Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/genetics; Escherichia coli/metabolism; Fertility; Gene Expression; Nematoda/metabolism; Plant Proteins/genetics; Plants, Genetically Modified; Trypsin Inhibitors; Tylenchoidea/metabolism; alpha-Amylases/antagonists & inhibitors",Cystatins; Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors; Plant Proteins; Trypsin Inhibitors; alpha-Amylases,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs004250050281 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs004250050281 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9684370,34,9684370,10.1007/s004250050281,2014870946,

In the case of glycerol, KP produced two main transfer products: saccharides A and B. The structure of saccharide A was O -α- D -glucopyranosyl-(1→1)-glycerol and that of saccharide B was O -α- D -glucopyranosyl-(1→2)- O -α- D -glucopyranosyl-(1→1)-glycerol. These results show that KP transferred a glucose residue to the hydroxyl group at position 1 of glycerol. On the other hand, when myo -inositol was used as an acceptor, KP produced four transfer products: saccharides 1–4. The structures of saccharides 1 and 2 were O -α- D -glucopyranosyl-(1→1)- and O -α- D -glucopyranosyl-(1→5)- myo -inositol, respectively; those of saccharides 3 and 4 were O -α- D -glucopyranosyl-(1→2)- O -α- D -glucopyranosyl-(1→1)- and O -α- D -glucopyranosyl-(1→2)- O -α- D -glucopyranosyl-(1→5)- myo -inositol, respectively. KP transferred a glucose residue to the hydroxyl group at position 1 or 5 of myo -inositol. On the basis of the structures of their glucosyl transfer products, glycerol and myo -inositol were found to have a common structure with three hydroxyl groups corresponding to the hydroxyl group of the glucose molecule at positions 2, 3 and 4. The conformation of these three hydroxyl groups in the structure is equatorial. This structure is the substrate recognition site of KP. It has been suggested that KP strictly recognizes the structures of glycerol and myo -inositol, and catalyzes the transfer reaction of a glucose residue to the hydroxyl group at position 1 in glycerol, and at position 1 or 5 in myo -inositol, corresponding to position 2 in glucose.",101,Disaccharides/chemistry; Electron Transport; Enzyme Activation; Glycerol/chemistry; Glycosylation; Inositol/chemistry; Protein Binding; Thermoanaerobacter/enzymology,Disaccharides; Inositol; kojibiose; Glycerol,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389172306706053 https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110004729573 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16781473 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389172306706053,5,16781473,10.1263/jbb.101.427,2043350896,

The axe1 gene presents an open reading frame of 1278 bp, including two introns of 68 and 61 bp; it codes for a signal peptide of 31 residues and a mature protein of 351 amino acids (molecular weight 36,693). AXE I has a modular structure: a catalytic module at the amino terminus belonging to family 1 of the carbohydrate esterases, a linker rich in serines and threonines, and a family 1 carboxy terminal carbohydrate binding module (CBM). The CBM is similar to that of AXE from Trichoderma reesei, (with a family 5 catalytic module) indicating that the genes for catalytic modules and CBMs have evolved separately, and that they have been linked by gene fusion. The promoter sequence of axe1 contains several putative sequences for binding of gene expression regulators also found in other family 1 esterase gene promoters.

Western blot analysis showed that these putative epitopes had affinity for the corresponding mAbs and β-Cat mutants that lack these regions did not bind to the antibodies, indicating we correctly mapped the epitope for these mAbs.

The gene contained an open reading frame consisting of 1437 bp (479 amino acids). The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein showed little similarity with other known glycoside hydrolases. A signal sequence (20 amino acids) was found at the N-terminal region of the protein and the molecular mass of the mature form was calculated to be 50.488 kDa. The gene product expressed in E. coli as a recombinant protein fused with thioredoxin and His 6 tags had almost the same substrate specificity and mode of action as native enzyme purified from a commercial cellulase preparation of T. viride , i.e. recombinant enzyme endo-hydrolysed β-(1→6)-galacto-oligomers with a DP (degree of polymerization) higher than 3, and it could also hydrolyse α-l-arabinofuranosidase-treated arabinogalactan protein from radish. It produced β-(1→6)-galacto-oligomers ranging from DP 2 to at least 8 at the initial hydrolysis stage and galactose and β-(1→6)-galactobiose as the major products at the final reaction stage.

Woolfson,"The coiled coil is arguably the simplest protein-structure motif and probably the most ubiquitous facilitator of protein-protein interactions. Coiled coils comprise two or more α-helices that wind around each other to form “supercoils”. The hallmark of most coiled coils is a regular sequence pattern known as the heptad repeat. Despite this apparent simplicity and relatedness at the sequence level, coiled coils display a considerable degree of structural diversity: the helices may be arranged parallel or anti-parallel and may form a variety of oligomer states. To aid studies of coiled coils, we developed SOCKET, a computer program to identify these motifs automatically in protein structures. We used SOCKET to gather a set of unambiguous coiled-coil structures from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. Rather than searching for sequence features, the algorithm recognises the characteristic knobs-into-holes side-chain packing of coiled coils; this proved to be straightforward to implement and was able to distinguish coiled coils from the great majority of helix-helix packing arrangements observed in globular domains. SOCKET unambiguously defines coiled-coil helix boundaries, oligomerisation states and helix orientations, and also assigns heptad registers. Structures retrieved from the Protein Data Bank included parallel and anti-parallel variants of two, three and four-stranded coiled coils, one example of a parallel pentamer and a small number of structures that extend the classical description of a coiled coil. We anticipate that our structural database and the associated sequence data that we have gathered will be of use in identifying principles for coiled-coil assembly, prediction and design. To illustrate this we give examples of sequence and structural analyses of the structures that are possible using the new data bases, and we present amino acid profiles for the heptad repeats of different motifs.",307,"Algorithms; Amino Acid Motifs; Amino Acid Sequence; Amino Acids/analysis; Binding Sites; Computational Biology/methods; DNA-Binding Proteins; Databases as Topic; Dimerization; Fungal Proteins/chemistry; Internet; Leucine Zippers; Models, Molecular; Protein Binding; Protein Kinases/chemistry; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Proteins/chemistry; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Software; Structure-Activity Relationship",Amino Acids; DNA-Binding Proteins; Fungal Proteins; Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Protein Kinases,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283601945450 https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11292353 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283601945450,7,11292353,10.1006/jmbi.2001.4545,2032155561,

Moffatt,"A gene expression system based on bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase has been developed. T7 RNA polymerase is highly selective for its own promoters, which do not occur naturally in Escherichia coli. A relatively small amount of T7 RNA polymerase provided from a cloned copy of T7 gene 1 is sufficient to direct high-level transcription from a T7 promoter in a multicopy plasmid. Such transcription can proceed several times around the plasmid without terminating, and can be so active that transcription by E. coli RNA polymerase is greatly decreased. When a cleavage site for RNase III is introduced, discrete RNAs of plasmid length can accumulate. The natural transcription terminator from T7 DNA also works effectively in the plasmid. Both the rate of synthesis and the accumulation of RNA directed by T7 RNA polymerase can reach levels comparable with those for ribosomal RNAs in a normal cell. These high levels of accumulation suggest that the RNAs are relatively stable, perhaps in part because their great length and/or stem-and-loop structures at their 3′ ends help to protect them against exonucleolytic degradation. It seems likely that a specific mRNA produced by T7 RNA polymerase can rapidly saturate the translational machinery of E. coli, so that the rate of protein synthesis from such an mRNA will depend primarily on the efficiency of its translation. When the mRNA is efficiently translated, a target protein can accumulate to greater than 50% of the total cell protein in three hours or less. We have used two ways to deliver active T7 RNA polymerase to the cell; infection by a lambda derivative that carries gene 1, or induction of a chromosomal copy of gene 1 under control of the lacUV5 promoter. When gene 1 is delivered by infection, very toxic target genes can be maintained silent in the cell until T7 RNA polymerase is introduced, when they rapidly become expressed at high levels. When gene 1 is resident in the chromosome, even the very low basal levels of T7 RNA polymerase present in the uninduced cell can prevent the establishment of plasmids carrying toxic target genes, or make the plasmid unstable. But if the target plasmid can be maintained, induction of chromosomal gene 1 can be a convenient way to produce large amounts of target RNA and/or protein. T7 RNA polymerase seems to be capable of transcribing almost any DNA linked to a T7 promoter, so the T7 expression system should be capable of transcribing almost any gene or its complement in E. coli. We expect that comparable T7 expression systems can be developed in other types of cell.",189,"Cloning, Molecular; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/genetics; Escherichia coli/genetics; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Vectors; Plasmids; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Biosynthesis; RNA, Viral/biosynthesis; T-Phages/enzymology; Transcription, Genetic; Viral Proteins/biosynthesis","RNA, Viral; Viral Proteins; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022283686903852 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3537305 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022283686903852,484,3537305,10.1016/0022-2836(86)90385-2,1975993749,

The ALDH showed a native molecular weight (Mr) of 100,000 and a subunit Mr of 55,000, suggesting that ALDH is dimeric. Purified ALDH contained no alcohol dehydrogenase activity. Activities measured with acetaldehyde and butyraldehyde as alternative substrates were copurified, indicating that the same ALDH can catalyze the formation of both aldehydes for ethanol and butanol production. Based on the Km and Vmax values for acetyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA, ALDH was more effective for the production of butyraldehyde than for acetaldehyde. ALDH could use either NAD(H) or NADP(H) as the coenzyme, but the Km for NAD(H) was much lower than that for NADP(H). Kinetic data suggest a ping-pong mechanism for the reaction. ALDH was more stable in Tris buffer than in phosphate buffer. The apparent optimum pH was between 6.5 and 7 for the forward reaction (the physiological direction; aldehyde forming), and it was 9.5 or higher for the reverse reaction (acyl-CoA forming). The ratio of NAD(H)/NADP(H)-linked activities increased with decreasing pH. ALDH was O2 sensitive, but it could be protected against O2 inactivation by dithiothreitol.

The exquisite sensitivity and specificity of these responses are controlled in large part by the combinations of cis-regulatory elements that reside in gene promoters and adjacent control regions. Here, we present a study aimed at accurately modeling the relationship between combinations of cis-regulatory elements and the expression levels they drive in different environments. We constructed four libraries of synthetic promoters in yeast, consisting of combinations of transcription factor binding sites and assayed their expression in four different environments. Thermodynamic models relating promoter sequences to their corresponding four expression levels explained at least 56% of the variation in expression in each library through the different conditions. Analyses of these models suggested that a large fraction of regulated gene expression is explained by changes in the effective concentration of sequence-specific transcription factors, and we show that in most cases, the corresponding transcription factors are expressed in a pattern that is predicted by the thermodynamic models. Our analysis uncovered two binding sites that switch from activators to repressors in different environmental conditions. In both the cases, the switch was not the result of a single transcription factor changing regulatory modes, but most likely due to competition between multiple factors binding to the same site. Our analysis suggests that this mode of regulation allows for large and steep changes in expression in response to changing transcription factor concentrations. Our results demonstrate that many complex changes in gene expression are accurately explained by simple changes in the effective concentrations of transcription factors.",5,"Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Models, Biological; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Thermodynamics; Transcription Factors/physiology; Yeasts",Transcription Factors,http://msb.embopress.org/content/5/1/244.full.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2657533/ http://msb.embopress.org/content/5/1/244 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/msb.2009.1/full http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/msb.2009.1 https://digitalcommons.wustl.edu/open_access_pubs/1370/ https://utah.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/environment-specific-combinatorial-cis-regulation-in-synthetic-pr https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657533/ http://digitalcommons.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2372&context=open_access_pubs http://msb.embopress.org/content/msb/5/1/244.full.pdf,1,19225457,10.1038/msb.2009.1,2137794200,PMC2657533

We partially sequenced over 5100 random T. reesei cDNA clones. Among the sequences whose predicted gene products had significant similarity to known proteins, 12 were identified that encode previously unknown enzymes that likely function in biomass degradation. Microarrays were used to query the expression levels of each of the sequences under different conditions known to induce cellulolytic enzyme synthesis. Most of the genes encoding known and putative biomass-degrading enzymes were transcriptionally co-regulated. Moreover, despite the fact that several of these enzymes are not thought to degrade cellulase directly, they were coordinately overexpressed in a cellulase overproducing strain. A variety of additional sequences whose function could not be ascribed using the limited sequence available displayed analogous behavior and may also play a role in biomass degradation or in the synthesis of biomass-degrading enzymes. Sequences exhibiting additional regulatory patterns were observed that might reflect roles in regulation of cellulase biosynthesis. However, genes whose products are involved in protein processing and secretion were not highly regulated during cellulase induction.",278,"Biomass; DNA, Complementary; Enzymes/genetics; Expressed Sequence Tags; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Hydrolysis; Molecular Sequence Data; Transcription, Genetic; Trichoderma/enzymology","DNA, Complementary; Enzymes",http://www.jbc.org/content/278/34/31988.long https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12788920 http://www.jbc.org/content/early/2003/06/04/jbc.M304750200.full.pdf,160,12788920,10.1074/jbc.m304750200,2127500237,

Swinney,"We have measured the multiscale wrinkling that occurs along the edge of torn plastic sheets. The plastic deformations produced by tearing define a new metric on the sheet, which then relaxes elastically. The resultant patterns of wrinkles correspond to a superposition of waves of different wavelengths. Measurements of the variation of the pattern as a function of the distance from the edge reveal a set of transitions, each of which adds a new mode to the cascade. The wavelengths in the cascade depend on both a geometrical length scale Lgeo given by the metric near the sheet’s edge, and the sheet thickness t: t 0.3 Lgeo . This scaling implies vanishingly short wavelengths in the limit t → 0. A possible geometrical origin of this behavior is discussed. Finally, we show that our measurement and analysis techniques are applicable to the study of some wavy patterns of leaves. These measurements reveal that the intrinsic geometry of a wavy leaf resembles that of the torn plastic sheets. This supports the possibility that some leaves form waves through a spontaneous wrinkling, rather than through an explicit three-dimensional construction.",75,,,https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.75.046211 http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007PhRvE..75d6211S http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17500982 http://www.pmmh.espci.fr/~benoit/publi/Sharon07b.pdf http://chaos.utexas.edu/manuscripts/1168183519.pdf,1,,10.1103/physreve.75.046211,2144861495,

A consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. In order to make all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) accessible for diversification, the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the CDRs. Molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present. We could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of E. coli. A first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling 2 10 9 members was created after cloning the genes in all 49 combinations into a phagemid vector, itself devoid of the restriction sites in question. Diversity was created by replacing the VH and VL CDR3 regions of the master genes by CDR3 library cassettes, generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody CDR3 sequences. The sequencing of 257 members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was 61 %. Selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities. Due to the modular design of all master genes, either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence, using pre-built CDR cassette libraries. The small number of 49 master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly, and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes. # 2000 Academic Press",296,"Amino Acid Sequence; Antibody Affinity; Antibody Diversity; Cloning, Molecular; Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques; Consensus Sequence/genetics; Escherichia coli/genetics; Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics; Humans; Immunoglobulin Variable Region/biosynthesis; Kinetics; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Insertional/genetics; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/genetics; Peptide Library; Protein Conformation; Protein Folding; Random Allocation; Reproducibility of Results; Sequence Alignment; Solubility; Thermodynamics",Immunoglobulin Variable Region; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides; Peptide Library,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283699934447 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.18.9299&rep=rep1&type=pdf http://www.bioc.unizh.ch/antibody/Publications/PDF/JMB296_2000_57.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10656818 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283699934447 http://www.bioc.uzh.ch/plueckthun/antibody/Publications/PDF/JMB296_2000_57.pdf,766,10656818,10.1006/jmbi.1999.3444,2144886557,

Experimental designs for genome-wide ascertainment of somatic mutations now routinely include next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumour DNA and matched constitutional DNA from the same individual. This allows investigators to control for germline polymorphisms and distinguish somatic mutations that are unique to the tumour, thus reducing the burden of labour-intensive and expensive downstream experiments needed to verify initial predictions. In order to make full use of such paired datasets, computational tools for simultaneous analysis of tumour–normal paired sequence data are required, but are currently under-developed and under-represented in the bioinformatics literature.; ; Results: In this contribution, we introduce two novel probabilistic graphical models called JointSNVMix1 and JointSNVMix2 for jointly analysing paired tumour–normal digital allelic count data from NGS experiments. In contrast to independent analysis of the tumour and normal data, our method allows statistical strength to be borrowed across the samples and therefore amplifies the statistical power to identify and distinguish both germline and somatic events in a unified probabilistic framework.; ; Availability: The JointSNVMix models and four other models discussed in the article are part of the JointSNVMix software package available for download at http://compbio.bccrc.ca; ; Contact: ac.crccb@hahss; ; Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",28,"Computational Biology/methods; DNA Mutational Analysis/methods; DNA, Neoplasm/genetics; Humans; Models, Statistical; Mutation; Neoplasms/genetics; Software","DNA, Neoplasm",http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22285562 http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/01/27/bioinformatics.bts053.full.pdf http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/bioinformatics/bioinformatics28.html#RothDMCHGBHTOMAS12 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3315723 https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/28/7/907/209164 https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bts053 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22285562,4,22285562,10.1093/bioinformatics/bts053,2099377894,

Southern analysis reveals the presence of a homogeneous pool of linear plasmid molecules in mycelium of transformants. Addition of the AMA1 plasmid replicator to the telomere-containing plasmids has only a minor effect on transformation. The phenotypic stability of the transformants is low. However, unlike conventional replicative transformants containing AMA1-bearing plasmids, these transformants are prone to spontaneous stabilization which occurs predominantly by conversion of the mutant chromosomal allele of the marker gene to the plasmid-borne allele. The data strongly suggest that telomeric DNA can act as a plasmid replicator.

To further our understanding of this enzyme, the present study characterized the site-specific DNA cleavage reaction of PBCV-1 topoisomerase II.

The DNA cleavage site utilization of PBCV-1 topoisomerase II is remarkably similar to that of human topoisomerase IIα, but the viral enzyme cleaves these sites to a far greater extent.

Natural lipocalins occur in human plasma and body fluids, where they usually function in the transport of vitamins, steroids or metabolic compounds. Using targeted mutagenesis of the loop region and biochemical selection techniques, variants with novel ligand specificities, both for low-molecular weight substances and for macromolecular protein targets, can be generated.

A branched mRNA template was developed which carries a peptidyl acceptor and a reverse transcription primer at the 3′-end. Translation in vitro followed by reverse transcription produced a protein covalently bonded to its encoding cDNA. Both single- and double-stranded cDNA–protein fusions were prepared. cDNA–protein fusions are stable in alkali and resistant to ribonucleases. Their simple preparation and their resistance towards degradation should make cDNA–protein fusions a useful tool for the in vitro selection and evolution of high affinity ligands from large libraries of polypeptides.,2,"Artificial Gene Fusion/methods; Base Sequence; Cells, Cultured; Culture Media; DNA/chemistry; DNA, Complementary/chemistry; DNA, Single-Stranded/chemistry; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Oligonucleotide Probes/chemistry; Peptides/chemistry; Precipitin Tests; Proteins/chemistry; RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Templates, Genetic; Transcription, Genetic","Culture Media; DNA, Complementary; DNA, Single-Stranded; Oligonucleotide Probes; Peptides; Proteins; RNA, Messenger; DNA",http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/1439-7633%2820010903%292%3A9%3C666%3A%3AAID-CBIC666%3E3.0.CO%3B2-%23 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1439-7633(20010903)2:9%3C666::AID-CBIC666%3E3.0.CO;2-%23/pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11828503,25,11828503,10.1002/1439-7633(20010903)2:9<666::aid-cbic666>3.0.co;2-#,2082606235,

Glass DNA arrays containing a selected set of 1,019 genes (including all 178 pSOL1 genes) covering more than 25% of the whole genome were designed, constructed, and validated for data reliability. Strain SKO1, with an inactivated spo0A gene, displays an asporogenous, filamentous, and largely deficient solventogenic phenotype. SKO1 displays downregulation of all solvent formation genes, sigF, and carbohydrate metabolism genes (similar to genes expressed as part of the stationary-phase response in Bacillus subtilis) but also several electron transport genes. A major cluster of genes upregulated in SKO1 includes abrB, the genes from the major chemotaxis and motility operons, and glycosylation genes. Strain M5 displays an asporogenous and nonsolventogenic phenotype due to loss of the megaplasmid pSOL1, which contains all genes necessary for solvent formation. Therefore, M5 displays downregulation of all pSOL1 genes expressed in the WT. Notable among other genes expressed more highly in WT than in M5 were sigF, several two-component histidine kinases, spo0A, cheA, cheC, many stress response genes, fts family genes, DNA topoisomerase genes, and central-carbon metabolism genes. Genes expressed more highly in M5 include electron transport genes (but different from those downregulated in SKO1) and several motility and chemotaxis genes. Most of these expression patterns were consistent with phenotypic characteristics.

Melamine deaminase displaced two of the three amino groups from melamine, producing ammeline and ammelide as sequential products. The first deamination reaction occurred more than 10 times faster than the second. Ammelide did not inhibit the first or second deamination reaction, suggesting that the lower rate of ammeline hydrolysis was due to differential substrate turnover rather than product inhibition. Remarkably, melamine deaminase is 98% identical to the enzyme atrazine chlorohydrolase (AtzA) from Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP. Each enzyme consists of 475 amino acids and differs by only 9 amino acids. AtzA was shown to exclusively catalyze dehalogenation of halo-substituted triazine ring compounds and had no activity with melamine and ammeline. Similarly, melamine deaminase had no detectable activity with the halo-triazine substrates. Melamine deaminase was active in deamination of a substrate that was structurally identical to atrazine, except for the substitution of an amino group for the chlorine atom. Moreover, melamine deaminase and AtzA are found in bacteria that grow on melamine and atrazine compounds, respectively. These data strongly suggest that the 9 amino acid differences between melamine deaminase and AtzA represent a short evolutionary pathway connecting enzymes catalyzing physiologically relevant deamination and dehalogenation reactions, respectively.",183,"Amino Acid Sequence; Aminohydrolases; Binding, Competitive; Cloning, Molecular; Escherichia coli/enzymology; Hydrolases/chemistry; Hydrolysis; Molecular Sequence Data; Proteins/genetics; Pseudomonas/enzymology; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Substrate Specificity; Triazines/metabolism",Proteins; Triazines; Hydrolases; Aminohydrolases; melamine deaminase; atrazine chlorohydrolase; melamine,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC95154 http://jb.asm.org/content/183/8/2405.full?view=long&pmid=11274097 https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/melamine-deaminase-and-atrazine-chlorohydrolase-98-percent-identi https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC95154/ http://jb.asm.org/content/183/8/2405.full.pdf,1692,11274097,10.1128/jb.183.8.2405-2410.2001,2158783389,PMC95154

For example, it is known that many homologous regulators in yeasts and mammals can recognize the same (or closely related) DNA sequences. In contrast to this paradigm, we describe a case in which the DNA-binding specificity of a transcription regulator has changed so extensively (and over a much smaller evolutionary distance) that its cis-regulatory sequence appears unrelated in different species. Bioinformatic, genetic, and biochemical approaches were used to document and analyze a major change in the DNA-binding specificity of Matα1, a regulator of cell-type specification in ascomycete fungi. Despite this change, Matα1 controls the same core set of genes in the hemiascomycetes because its DNA recognition site has evolved with it, preserving the protein-DNA interaction but significantly changing its molecular details. Matα1 and its recognition sequence diverged most dramatically in the common ancestor of the CTG-clade (Candida albicans, Candida lusitaniae, and related species), apparently without the aid of a gene duplication event. Our findings suggest that DNA-binding specificity divergence between orthologous transcription regulators may be more prevalent than previously thought and that seemingly unrelated cis-regulatory sequences can nonetheless be homologous.

Herein, we report a well-characterized nucleic acid proximity-based assay using antibodies, called Proximity Extension Assay (PEA), showing good performance in plasma samples. Target-specific antibody pairs are linked to DNA strands that upon simultaneous binding to the target analyte create a real-time PCR amplicon in a proximity-dependent manner enabled by the action of a DNA polymerase. 3′Exonuclease-capable polymerases were found to be clearly superior in sensitivity over non-3′exonuclease ones. A PEA was set up for IL-8 and GDNF in a user-friendly, homogenous assay displaying femtomolar detection sensitivity, good recovery in human plasma, high specificity and up to 5-log dynamic range in 1 μL samples. Furthermore, we have illustrated the use of a macro-molecular crowding matrix in combination with this homogeneous assay to drive target binding for low-affinity antibodies, thereby improving the sensitivity and increasing affinity reagent availability by lowering assay development dependency on high-affinity antibodies.

This bacterium produces and secretes a highly active multienzyme complex, the cellulosome, that mediates the cell attachment to and hydrolysis of the crystalline cellulosic substrate. C. thermocellum can efficiently utilize only β-1,3 and β-1,4 glucans and prefers long cellodextrins. Since the bacterium can also produce ethanol, it is considered an attractive candidate for a consolidated fermentation process in which cellulose hydrolysis and ethanol fermentation occur in a single process. In this study, we have identified and characterized five sugar ABC transporter systems in C. thermocellum. The putative transporters were identified by sequence homology of the putative solute-binding lipoprotein to known sugar-binding proteins. Each of these systems is transcribed from a gene cluster, which includes an extracellular solute-binding protein, one or two integral membrane proteins, and, in most cases, an ATP-binding protein. The genes of the five solute-binding proteins were cloned, fused to His tags, overexpressed, and purified, and their abilities to interact with different sugars was examined by isothermal titration calorimetry. Three of the sugar-binding lipoproteins (CbpB to -D) interacted with different lengths of cellodextrins (G2 to G5), with disassociation constants in the micromolar range. One protein, CbpA, binds only cellotriose (G3), while another protein, Lbp (laminaribiose-binding protein) interacts with laminaribiose. The sugar specificity of the different binding lipoproteins is consistent with the observed substrate preference of C. thermocellum, in which cellodextrins (G3 to G5) are assimilated faster than cellobiose.",191,"ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics; Bacterial Proteins/genetics; Base Sequence; Biological Transport; Calorimetry; Cellulose/analogs & derivatives; Clostridium thermocellum/enzymology; DNA Primers; Dextrins/metabolism; Disaccharides/metabolism; Glucose/metabolism; Gram-Positive Bacteria/metabolism; Lactose; Molecular Sequence Data; Multienzyme Complexes/metabolism; Plasmids; RNA, Bacterial/genetics; Transcription, Genetic; beta-Glucans/metabolism","ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters; Bacterial Proteins; DNA Primers; Dextrins; Disaccharides; Multienzyme Complexes; RNA, Bacterial; beta-Glucans; laminaribiose; Cellulose; cellodextrin; Glucose; Lactose",http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/18952792 http://jb.asm.org/content/early/2008/10/24/JB.01190-08.full.pdf+html http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2612431 http://jb.asm.org/content/191/1/203.full https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103264249 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18952792 http://jb.asm.org/content/191/1/203.full.pdf,4,18952792,10.1128/jb.01190-08,2056463915,

We have developed and applied molecular encoding principles to solve this source-uncertainty problem for DNA sequences generated by standard PCR. Batch-stamps specify the date and sample identity, and barcodes detect template redundancy. Our approach thus enables classification of each PCR-derived sequence as valid, contaminant, or redundant, and provides a measure of sequence diversity.

We here present the development of a binding scaffold based on variable lymphocyte receptors, which are nonimmunoglobulin antibodies composed of Leucine-rich repeat modules in jawless vertebrates, by module engineering. A template scaffold was first constructed by joining consensus repeat modules between the N- and C-capping motifs of variable lymphocyte receptors. The N-terminal domain of the template scaffold was redesigned based on the internalin-B cap by analyzing the modular similarity between the respective repeat units using a computational approach. The newly designed scaffold, termed “Repebody,” showed a high level of soluble expression in bacteria, displaying high thermodynamic and pH stabilities. Ease of molecular engineering was shown by designing repebodies specific for myeloid differentiation protein-2 and hen egg lysozyme, respectively, by a rational approach. The crystal structures of designed repebodies were determined to elucidate the structural features and interaction interfaces.

Here, we apply a synthetic hybrid promoter approach for the creation of strong promoter libraries in the model yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Synthetic hybrid promoters are composed of two modular components—the enhancer element, consisting of tandem repeats or combinations of upstream activation sequences (UAS), and the core promoter element. We demonstrate the utility of this approach with three main case studies. First, we establish a dynamic range of constitutive promoters and in doing so expand transcriptional capacity of the strongest constitutive yeast promoter, PGPD, by 2.5-fold in terms of mRNA levels. Second, we demonstrate the capacity to impart synthetic regulation through a hybrid promoter approach by adding galactose activation and removing glucose repression. Third, we establish a collection of galactose-inducible hybrid promoters that span a nearly 50-fold dynamic range of galactose-induced expression levels and increase the transcriptional capacity of the Gal1 promoter by 15%. These results demonstrate that promoters in S. cerevisiae, and potentially all yeast, are enhancer limited and a synthetic hybrid promoter approach can expand, enhance, and control promoter activity.

Vinetski; Clutterbuck Aj,"We describe a new method of gene cloning by complementation of mutant alleles which obviates the need for construction of a gene library in a plasmid vector in vitro and its amplification in Escherichia coli. The method involves simultaneous transformation of mutant strains of the fungus Aspergillus nidulans with (i) fragmented chromosomal DNA from a donor species and (ii) DNA of a plasmid without a selectable marker gene, but with a fungal origin of DNA replication (‘helper plasmid’). Transformant colonies appear as the result of the Joining of chromosomal DNA fragments carrying the wild-type copies of the mutant allele with the helper plasmid. Joining may occur either by ligation (if the helper plasmid is in linear form) or recombination (if it is cccDNA). This event occurs with high efficiency in vivo, and generates an autonomously replicating plasmid cointegrate.

Using a combination of sequence and structure consensus analyses, we designed a 33 amino acid residue AR module with seven randomized positions having a theoretical diversity of 7.2×10 7 . Different numbers of this module were cloned between N and C-terminal capping repeats, i.e. ARs designed to shield the hydrophobic core of stacked AR modules. In this manner, combinatorial libraries of designed AR proteins consisting of four to six repeats were generated, thereby potentiating the theoretical diversity. All randomly chosen library members were expressed in soluble form in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli in amounts up to 200 mg per 1 l of shake-flask culture. Virtually pure proteins were obtained in a single purification step. The designed AR proteins are monomeric and display CD spectra identical with those of natural AR proteins. At the same time, our AR proteins are highly thermostable, with T m values ranging from 66 °C to well above 85 °C. Thus, our combinatorial library members possess the properties required for biotechnological applications. Moreover, the favorable biophysical properties and the modularity of the AR fold may account, partly, for the abundance of natural AR proteins.",332,"Amino Acid Sequence; Ankyrin Repeat; Base Sequence; Circular Dichroism; Consensus Sequence; Databases, Protein; Gene Library; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Protein Engineering; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Repetitive Sequences, Amino Acid; Temperature",,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283603008969 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Plueckthun/publication/10588144_Designing_repeat_proteins_well-expressed_soluble_and_stable_proteins_from_combinatorial_libraries_of_consensus_ankyrin_repeat_proteins/links/09e4150eef90f27f50000000.pdf?origin=publication_detail http://www.bioc.unizh.ch/plueckthun/pdf/APpub0239.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12948497 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283603008969 http://www.bioc.uzh.ch/plueckthun/pdf/APpub0239.pdf,135,12948497,10.2210/pdb2xeh/pdb; 10.1016/s0022-2836(03)00896-9; 10.2210/pdb2xee/pdb,2092803887,

In bacteria and archaea, distinct genes encode the two proteins. In several organisms from the eukaryotic phylum of coelomate metazoans, the two polypeptides are carried by a single polypeptide chain to form a bifunctional protein. The linker region is made of imperfectly repeated units also recovered as singular or plural elements connected as N-terminal or C-terminal polypeptide extensions in various eukaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Phylogenetic analysis points to the monophyletic origin of this polypeptide motif appended to six different members of the synthetase family, belonging to either of the two classes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. In particular, the monospecific GluRS and ProRS from Caenorhabditis elegans , an acoelomate metazoan, exhibit this recurrent motif as a C-terminal or N-terminal appendage, respectively. Our analysis of the extant motifs suggests a possible series of events responsible for a gene fusion that gave rise to the bifunctional glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase through recombination between genomic sequences encoding the repeated units.",470,"Amino Acid Motifs; Amino Acid Sequence; Amino Acyl-tRNA Synthetases/chemistry; Animals; Arabidopsis; Caenorhabditis elegans/enzymology; Cloning, Molecular; Cricetinae; Crossing Over, Genetic/genetics; DNA, Complementary/genetics; Evolution, Molecular; Glutamate-tRNA Ligase/chemistry; Humans; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Recombination, Genetic/genetics; Repetitive Sequences, Amino Acid/genetics; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Yeasts","DNA, Complementary; Amino Acyl-tRNA Synthetases; prolyl T RNA synthetase; Glutamate-tRNA Ligase",http://www.febsletters.org/article/S0014579300013430/pdf http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579300013430 https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0014-5793%2800%2901343-0 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20013010196 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10745085 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579300013430 https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/S0014-5793%2800%2901343-0 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81999442.pdf,1,10745085,10.1016/s0014-5793(00)01343-0,2084546178,

Successful preparation of the giant liposomes at high ionic strengths required the inclusion of 10–20% of a charged lipid, such as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid, or cardiolipin, in phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine. Three criteria were employed to identify unilamellar liposomes, yielding consistent results. Under a phase-contrast microscope those liposomes that showed the thinnest contour and had a vigorously undulating membrane were judged unilamellar. When liposomes were stained with the lipophilic fluorescent dye octadecyl rhodamine B, fluorescence intensities of the membrane of individual liposomes were integer multiples (up to four) of the lowest ones, the least fluorescent liposomes being those also judged unilamellar in the phase-contrast image.

C. Stemmer,"Green fluorescent protein (GFP) has rapidly become a widely used reporter of gene regulation. However, for many organisms, particularly eukaryotes, a stronger whole cell fluorescence signal is desirable. We constructed a synthetic GFP gene with improved codon usage and performed recursive cycles of DNA shuffling followed by screening for the brightest E. coli colonies. A visual screen using UV light, rather than FACS selection, was used to avoid red-shifting the excitation maximum. After 3 cycles of DNA shuffling, a mutant was obtained with a whole cell fluorescence signal that was 45-fold greater than a standard, the commercially available Clontech plasmid pGFP. The expression level in E. coli was unaltered at about 75% of total protein. The emission and excitation maxima were also unchanged. Whereas in E. coli most of the wildtype GFP ends up in inclusion bodies, unable to activate its chromophore, most of the mutant protein is soluble and active. Three amino acid mutations appear to guide the mutant protein into the native folding pathway rather than toward aggregation. Expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, this shuffled GFP mutant showed a 42-fold improvement over wildtype GFP sequence, and is easily detected with UV light in a wide range of assays. The results demonstrate how molecular evolution can solve a complex practical problem without needing to first identify which process is limiting. DNA shuffling can be combined with screening of a moderate number of mutants. We envision that the combination of DNA shuffling and high throughput screening will be a powerful tool for the optimization of many commercially important enzymes for which selections do not exist.",14,"Animals; Base Sequence; Biotechnology; CHO Cells; Cricetinae; DNA Primers/genetics; DNA, Recombinant/genetics; Directed Molecular Evolution; Escherichia coli/genetics; Fluorescence; Gene Expression; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Luminescent Proteins/chemistry; Mutagenesis; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Protein Engineering; Recombinant Proteins/chemistry","DNA Primers; DNA, Recombinant; Luminescent Proteins; Recombinant Proteins; Green Fluorescent Proteins",http://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0396-315.pdf http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/80008850018 http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v14/n3/full/nbt0396-315.html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9630892,437,9630892,10.1038/nbt0396-315,2087823077,

Several such systems have been developed for eukaryotes1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Most of these rely on the administration of either exogenous chemicals or heat shock. Despite the general success of many of these systems, the potential for problems, such as toxic, unintended, or pleiotropic effects of the inducing chemical or treatment, can impose limitations on their use. We have developed a promoter system that can be induced, rapidly and reversibly, by short pulses of light. This system is based on the known red light–induced binding of the plant photoreceptor phytochrome to the protein PIF3 and the reversal of this binding by far-red light7, 8. We show here that yeast cells expressing two chimeric proteins, a phytochrome–GAL4-DNA-binding-domain fusion and a PIF3–GAL4-activation-domain fusion, are induced by red light to express selectable or ""scorable"" marker genes containing promoters with a GAL4 DNA-binding site, and that this induction is rapidly abrogated by subsequent far-red light. We further show that the extent of induction can be controlled precisely by titration of the number of photons delivered to the cells by the light pulse. Thus, this system has the potential to provide rapid, noninvasive, switchable control of the expression of a desired gene to a preselected level in any suitable cell by simple exposure to a light signal.",20,"Arabidopsis Proteins; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Cells, Cultured; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal/radiation effects; Gene Transfer Techniques; Light; Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins/genetics; Phytochrome/genetics; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Signal Transduction/genetics; Species Specificity; Transgenes; Yeasts/classification","Arabidopsis Proteins; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; PIF3 protein, Arabidopsis; Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Phytochrome",http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt734 http://openwetware.org/images/7/71/2002_Sato.pdf http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nbt734 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12219076,24,12219076,10.1038/nbt734,2003885556,

Meyer,"A novel α-l-arabinofuranosidase (α-AraF) belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 43 was cloned from Humicola insolens and expressed in Aspergillus oryzae. 1H-NMR analysis revealed that the novel GH43 enzyme selectively hydrolysed (1→3)-α-l-arabinofuranosyl residues of doubly substituted xylopyranosyl residues in arabinoxylan and in arabinoxylan-derived oligosaccharides. The optimal activity of the cloned enzyme was at pH 6.7 and 53 °C. Two other novel α-l-arabinofuranosidases (α-AraFs), both belonging to GH family 51, were cloned from H. insolens and from the white-rot basidiomycete Meripilus giganteus. Both GH51 enzymes catalysed removal of (1→2) and (1→3)-α-l-arabinofuranosyl residues from singly substituted xylopyranosyls in arabinoxylan; the highest arabinose yields were obtained with the M. giganteus enzyme. Combinations (50:50) of the GH43 α-AraF from H. insolens and the GH51 α-AraFs from either M. giganteus or H. insolens resulted in a synergistic increase in arabinose release from water-soluble wheat arabinoxylan in extended reactions at pH 6 and 40 °C. This synergistic interaction between GH43 and GH51 α-AraFs was also evident when a GH43 α-AraF from a Bifidobacterium sp. was supplemented in combination with either of the GH51 enzymes. The synergistic effect is presumed to be a result of the GH51 α-AraFs being able to catalyse the removal of single-sitting (1→2)–α-l-arabinofuranosyls that resulted after the GH43 enzyme had catalysed the removal of (1→3)–α-l-arabinofuranosyl residues on doubly substituted xylopyranosyls in the wheat arabinoxylan.",73,"Amino Acid Sequence; Arabinose/metabolism; Ascomycota/enzymology; Aspergillus oryzae/genetics; Bifidobacterium/enzymology; Cloning, Molecular; Enzyme Stability; Gene Expression; Glycoside Hydrolases/genetics; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Molecular Sequence Data; Oligosaccharides/metabolism; Polyporales/enzymology; Sequence Alignment; Substrate Specificity; Temperature; Triticum; Xylans/metabolism",Oligosaccharides; Xylans; arabinoxylan; Arabinose; Glycoside Hydrolases; alpha-N-arabinofuranosidase,http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=18340066 http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400060762 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00253-006-0543-y https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00253-006-0543-y https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16944135 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00253-006-0543-y.pdf,17,16944135,10.1007/s00253-006-0543-y,2085744716,

Although the amount of noise decreases with and is thus partly determined by the mean expression level, the extent to which different promoter sequences can deviate away from this trend is not fully known. Here, we present a high-throughput method for measuring promoter-driven noise for thousands of designed synthetic promoters in parallel. We use it to investigate how promoters encode different noise levels and find that the noise levels of promoters with similar mean expression levels can vary more than one order of magnitude, with nucleosome-disfavoring sequences resulting in lower noise and more transcription factor binding sites resulting in higher noise. We propose a kinetic model of gene expression that takes into account the nonspecific DNA binding and one-dimensional sliding along the DNA, which occurs when transcription factors search for their target sites. We show that this assumption can improve the prediction of the mean-independent component of expression noise for our designed promoter sequences, suggesting that a transcription factor target search may affect gene expression noise. Consistent with our findings in designed promoters, we find that binding-site multiplicity in native promoters is associated with higher expression noise. Overall, our results demonstrate that small changes in promoter DNA sequence can tune noise levels in a manner that is predictable and partly decoupled from effects on the mean expression levels. These insights may assist in designing promoters with desired noise levels.",24,"Binding Sites; Computational Biology/methods; DNA/metabolism; Gene Expression; Genes, Fungal; Linear Models; Molecular Sequence Data; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics; Transcription Factors/metabolism",Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Transcription Factors; DNA,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/25030889 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4199362 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25030889,1,25030889,10.1101/gr.168773.113,2136431975,

By using two of the activated ARCUTs simultaneously, DNA substrate was selectively cut at two predetermined sites, and the desired fragment was clipped and cloned. The DNA scission by ARCUT was also successful even when the target site was methylated by methyltransferase and protected from the corresponding restriction enzyme.

It also functions as a receptor for bacterial chemotaxis and is required for infection of the cell by bacteriophage lambda where it most likely functions as a pore for penetration of lambda DNA. The permease consists of three different subunits, IIIMan, II-PMan, and II-MMan, which are encoded in a single transcriptional unit ptsLPM. The complete amino acid sequence of the subunits is deduced from the nucleotide sequence. IIIMan (35 kDa) is a hydrophilic protein which is transiently phosphorylated and most likely contains the active site for sugar phosphorylation. II-PMan (28 kDa) is very hydrophobic; II-MMan (31 kDa) is moderately hydrophobic. Both are integral membrane proteins and most likely form the transmembrane channel. All three subunits are required for sugar transport and phosphorylation; II-PMan and II-MMan alone are sufficient for penetration of lambda DNA.

The majority of signaling proteins are multidomain in character with a considerable variety of domain combinations known. Comparison with established databases showed that 25% of our domain set could not be deduced from SwissProt and 41% could not be annotated by Pfam. SMART is able to determine the modular architectures of single sequences or genomes; application to the entire yeast genome revealed that at least 6.7% of its genes contain one or more signaling domains, approximately 350 greater than previously annotated. The process of constructing SMART predicted (i) novel domain homologues in unexpected locations such as band 4.1-homologous domains in focal adhesion kinases; (ii) previously unknown domain families, including a citron-homology domain; (iii) putative functions of domain families after identification of additional family members, for example, a ubiquitin-binding role for ubiquitin-associated domains (UBA); (iv) cellular roles for proteins, such predicted DEATH domains in netrin receptors further implicating these molecules in axonal guidance; (v) signaling domains in known disease genes such as SPRY domains in both marenostrin/pyrin and Midline 1; (vi) domains in unexpected phylogenetic contexts such as diacylglycerol kinase homologues in yeast and bacteria; and (vii) likely protein misclassifications exemplified by a predicted pleckstrin homology domain in a Candida albicans protein, previously described as an integrin.",95,Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Genome; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Proteins/genetics; Sequence Analysis; Software,Proteins,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/9600884 http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998PNAS...95.5857S http://en.journals.sid.ir/ViewPaper.aspx?ID=118732 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC34487 http://intl.pnas.org/content/95/11/5857.full?maxtoshow=&HITS=&RESULTFORMAT=&FIRSTINDEX=&author1=Milpetz%252C+F&author2=Bork%252C+P&titleabstract=SMART&searchid=QID_NOT_SET http://www.pnas.org/content/95/11/5857.full http://www.sid.ir/En/Journal/ViewPaper.aspx?ID=118732 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC34487/ http://www.pnas.org/content/95/11/5857.full.pdf,198,9600884,10.1073/pnas.95.11.5857,1977922844,PMC34487

Because standard biological parts are utilized to build the synthetic systems, it is important that each of these standard parts is well characterized and has a corresponding mathematical model that could simulate the characteristics of the part. These models could be used in computer aided design (CAD) tools during the design stage to facilitate the building of the model of biological systems. This paper describes the development of a mathematical model that is able to simulate both the dynamic and static performance of a biological device created using standard parts. We modeled an example quorum sensing device that produces green fluorescent protein (GFP) as reporter in the presence of Acyl Homoserine Lactone (AHL). The parameters of the model were estimated using experimental results. The simulation results show that the model was able to simulate behavior similar to experimental results. Since it is important that these models and the content in the models can be searchable and readable by machines, standard SBML (system biology markup language) format was used to store the models.

We report the design and synthesis of a photocleavable fluorescent nucleoside triphosphate, one of the essential molecules required for the sequencing-by-synthesis approach. We synthesized this nucleoside triphosphate by attaching a fluorophore, 4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3α,4α-diaza-s-indacene propionic acid (BODIPY), to the 5 position of 2′-deoxyuridine triphosphate via a photocleavable 2-nitrobenzyl linker. We demonstrate that the nucleotide analogue can be faithfully incorporated by a DNA polymerase Thermo Sequenase into the growing DNA strand in a DNA-sequencing reaction and that its incorporation does not hinder the addition of the subsequent nucleotide. These results indicate that the nucleotide analogue is an excellent substrate for Thermo Sequenase. We also systematically studied the photocleavage of the fluorescent dye from a DNA molecule that contained the nucleotide analogue. UV irradiation at 340 nm of the DNA molecule led to the efficient release of the fluorescent dye, ensuring that a previous fluorescence signal did not leave any residue that could interfere with the detection of the next nucleotide. Thus, our results indicate that it should be feasible to use four different fluorescent dyes with distinct fluorescence emissions as unique tags to label the four nucleotides (A, C, G, and T) through the photocleavable 2-nitrobenzyl linker. These fluorescent tags can be removed easily by photocleavage after the identification of each nucleotide in the DNA sequencing-by-synthesis approach.",100,"Biotin; Boron Compounds; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Fluorescent Dyes; Oligonucleotides/metabolism; Photolysis; Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods","4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene; Boron Compounds; Fluorescent Dyes; Oligonucleotides; Biotin",http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/12515853 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC141009 http://www.pnas.org/content/100/2/414.full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC141009/ http://turroserver.chem.columbia.edu/PDF_db/publications_701_750/723.pdf http://www.pnas.org/content/100/2/414.full.pdf,133,12515853,10.1073/pnas.242729199,2082631942,PMC141009

The effect of mstA disruption was more subtle at low and intermediate dilution rates, pointing to some degree of functional redundancy in the high-affinity uptake system of A. niger. The mstA disruptant and a reference strain were cultivated in glucose-limited chemostat cultures at low, intermediate and high dilution rate (D=0.07 h(-1), 0.14 h(-1) and 0.20 h(-1)).

Here, we provide a protocol for achieving targeted genome modification by direct injection of TALEN mRNA into fertilized mouse oocytes.",,"Animals; Blastocyst/physiology; DNA End-Joining Repair; Endonucleases/chemistry; Female; Genetic Engineering/methods; Genomics/methods; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Microinjections; Oocytes/physiology; RNA, Messenger/administration & dosage; Recombination, Genetic","RNA, Messenger; Endonucleases",http://www.jove.com/pdf/50930/jove-protocol-50930-mouse-genome-engineering-using-designer-nucleases http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24747757 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4161146 https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/mouse-genome-engineering-using-designer-nucleases https://www.jove.com/video/50930/mouse-genome-engineering-using-designer-nucleases https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4161146/ https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Mouse-Genome-Engineering-Using-Designer-Nucleases-Hermann-%C4%8Cerm%C3%A1k/90d68fb837ce553efe15254ba1a62e81f42e7532/figure/0 http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/101217/1/Mouse%20Genome%20Engineering.pdf,4,24747757,10.3791/50930,2131519829,PMC4161146

Novel molecules are entering clinical study at a rate of nearly 40 per year, and the commercial pipeline includes approximately 240 mAb therapeutics in clinical studies that have not yet progressed to regulatory approval or been approved. Of particular interest are the 26 mAbs that are currently at Phase 3, when safety and efficacy data critical to approval is established. Phase 3 study lengths are typically two to four years, so results for some studies might be announced in 2010, but data from others might not be presented until 2014. This overview of the 26 candidates provides a brief description of the background and the on-going Phase 3 studies of each mAb. Additional mAbs that have progressed to regulatory review or been approved may also be in Phase 3 studies, but these, as well as Fc fusion proteins, have been excluded. Due to the large body of primary literature about the 26 candidates, only selected references are given, with a focus on recent publications and articles that were relevant to Phase 3 studies.

The optimal arabinose-releasing and xylan-depolymerizing enzyme activities were identified from data obtained when selected, recombinant enzymes were systematically supplemented to the different arabinoxylan substrates in mixtures; this examination revealed three novel α-l-arabinofuranosidase activities: (i) one GH51 enzyme from Meripilus giganteus and (ii) one GH51 enzyme from Humicola insolens, both able to catalyze arabinose release from singly substituted xylose; and (iii) one GH43 enzyme from H. insolens able to catalyze the release of arabinose from doubly substituted xylose. Treatment of water-soluble and water-insoluble wheat arabinoxylan with an enzyme cocktail containing a 20%:20%:20%:40% mixture and a 25%:25%:25%:25% mixture, respectively, of the GH43 α-l-arabinofuranosidase from H. insolens (Abf II), the GH51 α-l-arabinofuranosidase from M. giganteus (Abf III), a GH10 endo-1,4-β-xylanase from H. insolens (Xyl III), and a GH3 β-xylosidase from Trichoderma reesei (β-xyl) released 322 mg of arabinose and 512 mg of xylose per gram of water-soluble wheat arabinoxylan dry matter and 150 mg of arabinose and 266 mg of xylose per gram of water-insoluble wheat arabinoxylan dry matter after 24 h at pH 5, 50 °C. A 10%:40%:50% mixture of Abf II, Abf III, and β-xyl released 56 mg of arabinose and 91 mg of xylose per gram of vinasse dry matter after 24 h at pH 5, 50 °C. The optimal dosages of the “minimal” enzyme cocktails were determined to be 0.4, 0.3, and 0.2 g enzyme protein per kilogram of substrate dry matter for the water-soluble wheat arabinoxylan, the water-insoluble wheat arabinoxylan, and the vinasse, respectively. These enzyme protein dosage levels were ∼14, ∼18, and ∼27 times lower than the dosages used previously, when the same wheat arabinoxylan substrates were hydrolyzed with a combination of Ultraflo L and Celluclast 1.5 L, two commercially available enzyme preparations produced by H. insolens and T. reesei.",23,"Endo-1,4-beta Xylanases/chemistry; Enzyme Activation; Glycoside Hydrolases/chemistry; Hydrolysis; Plant Proteins/chemistry; Protein Engineering/methods; Recombinant Proteins/chemistry; Triticum/metabolism; Xylans/chemistry; Xylosidases/chemistry","Plant Proteins; Recombinant Proteins; Xylans; arabinoxylan; Glycoside Hydrolases; Xylosidases; exo-1,4-beta-D-xylosidase; alpha-N-arabinofuranosidase; Endo-1,4-beta Xylanases",http://doi.wiley.com/10.1021/bp0601701 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1021/bp0601701/abstract http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/enzymatic-hydrolysis-of-wheat-arabinoxylan-by-a-recombinant-minimal-enzyme-cocktail-containing-betaxylosidase-and-novel-endo14betaxylanase-and-alphalarabinofuranosidase-activities(1e085fcc-5f9b-4986-b507-dedf00ae4293)/export.html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17269676,18,17269676,10.1021/bp0601701,1986802076,

Subsequently, the cDNA coding for the secreted active portion of the human interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) was fused to the leader peptide sequence of the killer toxin.

From this metabolic route, several commercially important aromatic compounds can be obtained. We have selected Escherichia coli mutants that can transport glucose efficiently by a non-PTS uptake system.

Two simple additional treatments of the DNA, before transfection, produce a site-specific mutation frequency approaching 100%. The approach is applicable to phenotypically silent mutations in addition to those that can be selected. The high efficiency, approximately equal to 10-fold greater than that observed using current methods without enrichment procedures, is obtained by using a DNA template containing several uracil residues in place of thymine. This template has normal coding potential for the in vitro reactions typical of site-directed mutagenesis protocols but is not biologically active upon transfection into a wild-type (i.e., ung+) Escherichia coli host cell. Expression of the desired change, present in the newly synthesized non-uracil-containing covalently closed circular complementary strand, is thus strongly favored. The procedure has been applied to mutations introduced via both oligonucleotides and error-prone polymerization. In addition to its utility in changing DNA sequences, this approach can potentially be used to examine the biological consequences of specific lesions placed at defined positions within a gene.",82,"Base Sequence; Coliphages/genetics; DNA Glycosylases; DNA, Single-Stranded/analysis; DNA, Viral/analysis; Escherichia coli/genetics; Mutation; N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/metabolism; Phenotype; Transfection; Uracil/metabolism; Uracil-DNA Glycosidase","DNA, Single-Stranded; DNA, Viral; Uracil; DNA Glycosylases; N-Glycosyl Hydrolases; Uracil-DNA Glycosidase",http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985PNAS...82..488K http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC397064 http://www.pnas.org/content/82/2/488 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3881765 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780127655604500381 http://www.pnas.org/content/82/2/488.full.pdf,1568,3881765,10.1073/pnas.82.2.488,2036931150,

In the human and animal pathogen Salmonella typhimurium, the expression of genes encoding the secreted effector molecules Sip/Ssp ABCD, SigD, SptP and SopE requires both the AraC/XylS-like regulator InvF and the secretion chaperone SicA. In this work, an InvF binding site was identified in the promoter regions of three operons. SicA does not appear to affect InvF stability nor to bind DNA directly. However, SicA could be co-purified with InvF, suggesting that InvF and SicA interact with each other to activate transcription from the effector gene promoters. This is the first demonstration of a contact between a protein cofactor and an AraC/XylS family transcriptional regulator and, moreover, is the first direct evidence of an interaction between a transcriptional regulator and a TTSS chaperone.

Desai; Eleftherios T. Papoutsakis,"Clostridium acetobutylicum is a gram-positive, spore-forming, obligate anaerobe that is capable of fermenting a wide variety of sugars to acids (acetate and butyrate) and solvents (ethanol, acetone, and butanol). This organism was used extensively for the production of acetone and butanol from the First World War to the late 1950s, when the petrochemical process became economically superior. Research into the fermentation process has since focused on genetic evaluation and metabolic engineering of solventogenic clostridia in order to develop strains that have enhanced solvent production capabilities, with the objective of reviving the industrial fermentation process.; ; In the past 10 years, considerable effort has been spent on the development of tools for metabolic engineering of C. acetobutylicum. A genetic transfer system has been developed (32, 33, 39, 52), and many genes have been cloned and sequenced (2, 3, 7, 8, 37, 42–44, 57, 60). While these tools have been used successfully for overexpression of homologous genes (2, 3, 33, 38, 59), a method for downregulation of enzyme production is an equally essential metabolic engineering tool. Recently, reductions in enzyme levels in C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 have been achieved through gene inactivation with nonreplicative integrational plasmids (21, 22). This technique requires a DNA fragment from the host and a selection marker for each inactivated gene. While nonreplicative integrational plasmids are suitable for knocking out a single gene, they are not practical for more advanced metabolic engineering strategies. Here we report results of an investigation of antisense RNA (asRNA) strategies as alternative and possibly more flexible and empowering methods of enzyme level downregulation.; ; Gene expression in some naturally occurring systems is regulated through the action of small asRNA molecules. For example, a naturally occurring asRNA molecule has been implicated in the regulatory system of the glutamine synthetase gene (glnA) (16, 28) of a solventogenic clostridium strain, Clostridium sp. strain NCP262 (formerly C. acetobutylicum P262 [29]). It has been postulated that asRNA molecules function by hybridizing with complementary mRNA transcripts. It has been shown that the subsequent downregulation occurs by several possible mechanisms, including (i) inhibition of translation because the duplex RNA structure prevents access to the ribosome binding site, (ii) rapid degradation of the mRNA, possibly by duplex RNA-specific RNases, and (iii) inhibition of transcription of mRNA due to premature termination (11, 47, 48, 55). Although the mechanism of asRNA action is not completely understood, asRNA strategies have been used to downregulate levels of targeted gene products in prokaryotes (9, 14, 15, 31, 41). Most studies have focused on either determining the effectiveness of different asRNA strategies or elucidating the role of a structural gene targeted for downregulation. To our knowledge, only one study has examined the ability of asRNA strategies to alter primary metabolism. In this study, van den Berg et al. examined the role of hydrogenase in the metabolism of lactate by Desulfovibrio vulgaris (53), and the results suggested that artificial asRNA strategies are capable of affecting the primary metabolism of prokaryotes.; ; asRNA strategies may have a number of advantages over gene inactivation for metabolic engineering. In addition to rapid implementation, asRNA strategies can avoid the pitfalls of lethal mutations since complete inhibition of protein production is not likely. asRNA strategies may be used to inducibly repress protein production by using inducible promoters to transcribe asRNA. For example, Coleman et al. utilized the inducible lac promoter to decrease lipoprotein production 2- to 16-fold in the presence of the inducer isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (9). In addition, the use of growth stage-specific promoters could result in enzyme downregulation during specific stages of a fermentation so that more advanced metabolic engineering objectives could be accomplished. Finally, asRNA strategies may be used to downregulate the products of multiple genes by expressing multiple asRNAs from a single plasmid.; ; In contrast to efforts directed toward determining the mechanism of asRNA action or the reduction in the amount of a single gene product, our goal was to determine the effectiveness of asRNA in redirecting the primary metabolism of C. acetobutylicum. Specifically, we attempted to reduce the levels of the enzymes responsible for butyrate formation in C. acetobutylicum. Butyrate is produced from the metabolic intermediate butyryl coenzyme A (butyryl-CoA) in two steps. In the first step, butyryl-CoA is converted to butyryl phosphate by phosphotransbutyrylase (PTB). In the second step, butyrate kinase (BK) converts butyryl phosphate to butyrate, with concomitant production of ATP. The genes ptb and buk, which code for PTB and BK, respectively, are organized in the order ptb-buk in a single operon (60). We developed two plasmid constructs designed to produce asRNA complementary to either the ptb gene or the buk gene. Since it is thought that butyrate levels may play a role in the induction of solventogenesis and, specifically, solvent formation by C. acetobutylicum (23, 27, 51), downregulation of PTB and BK was expected to have a significant impact on primary metabolism.",65,"Acetone/metabolism; Base Sequence; Bioreactors; Butanols/metabolism; Butyrates/metabolism; Clostridium/enzymology; Ethanol/metabolism; Fermentation; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Genetic Engineering; Molecular Sequence Data; Phosphate Acetyltransferase/genetics; Phosphotransferases (Carboxyl Group Acceptor)/genetics; Plasmids/genetics; RNA, Antisense/genetics; RNA, Bacterial/genetics","Butanols; Butyrates; RNA, Antisense; RNA, Bacterial; Acetone; Ethanol; Phosphate Acetyltransferase; Phosphotransferases (Carboxyl Group Acceptor); butyrate kinase",http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/10049845 http://aem.asm.org/content/65/3/936.long http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC91126 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=494081 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10049845 http://aem.asm.org/content/65/3/936.full.pdf,13,10049845,,2124431991,

The various causes of double-strand breaks (DSBs) result in a diverse chemistry of DNA ends that must be repaired. Across NHEJ evolution, the enzymes of the NHEJ pathway exhibit a remarkable degree of structural tolerance in the range of DNA end substrate configurations upon which they can act. In vertebrate cells, the nuclease, DNA polymerases, and ligase of NHEJ are the most mechanistically flexible and multifunctional enzymes in each of their classes. Unlike repair pathways for more defined lesions, NHEJ repair enzymes act iteratively, act in any order, and can function independently of one another at each of the two DNA ends being joined. NHEJ is critical not only for the repair of pathologic DSBs as in chromosomal translocations, but also for the repair of physiologic DSBs created during variable (diversity) joinin...",79,"Animals; DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded; DNA Ligases/metabolism; DNA Repair; DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism; Deoxyribonucleases/metabolism; Humans",DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase; Deoxyribonucleases; DNA Ligases,http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.biochem.052308.093131 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/20192759 http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.biochem.052308.093131 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3079308/ https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.biochem.052308.093131#XR284 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3079308/ https://www.scienceopen.com/document?vid=a10718d0-17db-4f62-a2b0-b728ff08d4d9 http://www.tau.ac.il/~yossih/BG-reading/Lieber.MR.et.al---.pdf,38,20192759,10.1146/annurev.biochem.052308.093131,2164995160,PMC3079308

Since many human proteins with the potential to be used therapeutically are secreted and require post-translational modification for biological activity, eukaryotic expression-secretion systems have been targeted for development. Recent developments in DNA-mediated transformation systems have allowed the utilization of Aspergillus as a host for the production of recombinant proteins. Several features such as well-characterized genetics and the availability of many mutants make Aspergillus nidulans the organism of choice for development of expression secretion systems. Recombinant strains contain integrated expression cassettes often in multiple copy, which are mitotically stable. In this review, we discuss the recent progress made in the use of Aspergillus as expression secretion hosts for the production of proteins of therapeutic significance.",17,"Aspergillus nidulans/genetics; Cloning, Molecular/methods; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Genetic Markers; Genetic Vectors; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis",Genetic Markers; Recombinant Fusion Proteins,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1367014 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016816569190022N,9,1367014,10.1016/0168-1656(91)90022-n,1980972056,

The pH-sensitive liposomes can deliver encapsulated fluorescent molecules [calcein, fluoresceinated dextran, fluoresceinated polypeptide, and diphtheria toxin A chain (DTA)] into the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic delivery can be blocked in the presence of ammonium chloride or EDTA, indicating that the process requires a low-pH environment and the presence of divalent cations. Inhibition of cellular protein synthesis by DTA delivery from the pH-sensitive liposome is orders of magnitude greater than from the non-pH-sensitive liposome composition. The delivery of DTA into the cytoplasm by pH-sensitive liposomes is at least 0.01% of cell-associated liposomal DTA. There is no significant difference in the degradation rate of bovine serum albumin (BSA) or the rate of acidification of pH-sensitive dye, 8-hydroxy-l,3,6-pyrene-trisulfonate (HPTS), when delivered to cells in pH-sensitive and non-pH-sensitive liposomes. Thus the efficiency of cytoplasmic delivery is less than 10% of the cell-associated liposome contents, which is the smallest difference that can be detected by these two assays. Based upon the various assays used to measure liposome content disposition in the cell, we conclude that the efficiency of cytoplasmic delivery by the CHEMS/DOPE liposomes is greater than 0.01% and less than 10% of the cell-associated liposomal contents.",7,"Animals; Arylsulfonates/pharmacology; Cells, Cultured; Cytoplasm/metabolism; Diphtheria Toxin/pharmacology; Drug Carriers; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Liposomes; Mice; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Serum Albumin, Bovine/metabolism","Arylsulfonates; Diphtheria Toxin; Drug Carriers; Liposomes; Serum Albumin, Bovine; pyranine",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2172955 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1015908831507 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.rug.nl%3Apublications%2F91d91e5e-1b01-4cf7-a689-436ad110c5ba https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/publications/efficiency-of-cytoplasmic-delivery-by-phsensitive-liposomes-to-cells-in-culture(91d91e5e-1b01-4cf7-a689-436ad110c5ba)/export.html,38,2172955,10.1023/a:1015908831507,1597819472,

This allows the selection of antigen-binding domains directly from diverse libraries of V-genes. Now we show that heterodimeric Fab fragments can be assembled on the surface of the phage by linking one chain to the phage coat protein, and secreting the other into the bacterial periplasm. Furthermore by introducing an amber mutation between the antibody chain and the coat protein, we can either display the antibody on phage using supE strains of bacteria, or produce soluble Fab fragment using non-suppressor strains.

Karr; Markus W. Covert; Thimothy K. Lu,"Despite rapid advances over the last decade, synthetic biology lacks the predictive tools needed to enable rational design. Unlike established engineering disciplines, the engineering of synthetic gene circuits still relies heavily on experimental trial-and-error, a time-consuming and inefficient process that slows down the biological design cycle. This reliance on experimental tuning is because current modeling approaches are unable to make reliable predictions about the in vivo behavior of synthetic circuits. A major reason for this lack of predictability is that current models view circuits in isolation, ignoring the vast number of complex cellular processes that impinge on the dynamics of the synthetic circuit and vice versa. To address this problem, we present a modeling approach for the design of synthetic circuits in the context of cellular networks. Using the recently published whole-cell model of Mycoplasma genitalium, we examined the effect of adding genes into the host genome. We also investigated how codon usage correlates with gene expression and find agreement with existing experimental results. Finally, we successfully implemented a synthetic Goodwin oscillator in the whole-cell model. We provide an updated software framework for the whole-cell model that lays the foundation for the integration of whole-cell models with synthetic gene circuit models. This software framework is made freely available to the community to enable future extensions. We envision that this approach will be critical to transforming the field of synthetic biology into a rational and predictive engineering discipline.",23,"Cell Cycle/genetics; Codon/genetics; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Genes, Synthetic/genetics; Models, Biological; Mycoplasma/cytology; Synthetic Biology/methods",Codon,http://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4811182 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23822510 http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/chaos/23/2/10.1063/1.4811182 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3695969 https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4811182 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=4720085 https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/100960 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3695969/ http://research.mssm.edu/karr/doc/papers/Purcell2013.pdf http://www.karrlab.org/static/doc/papers/Purcell2013.pdf https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.4811182,6,23822510,10.1063/1.4811182,2026039411,PMC3695969

In this work the primary determinant of T7 versus T3 promoter specificity has been localized to a single amino acid residue at position 748 in the T7 RNAP. Substitution of this residue (Asn) with the corresponding residue found in T3 RNAP (Asp) results in a switch in promoter specificity, and specifically alters recognition of the base pairs (bp) at positions −11 and, possibly, −10 in the promoter. A complementary mutation in T3 RNAP (T3-D749N) results in a similar switch in promoter preference for that enzyme. The hierarchy of bp preference by the mutant and wild-type enzymes for bp at −10 and −11, and the results of previous experiments, lead to a model for specificity in which it is proposed that N748 in T7 RNAP (and D749 in T3 RNAP) make specific hydrogen bonds with bases at −11 and −10 on the non-template strand in the major groove.

Soft drugs are new therapeutic agents that undergo predictable metabolism to inactive metabolites after exerting their therapeutic effect. Hence, they are obtained by building into the molecule, in addition to the activity, the most desired way in which the molecule is to be deactivated and detoxified. In an attempt to systematize and summarize the related work done in a number of laboratories, including ours, the present review presents an overview of the general soft drug design principles and provides a variety of specific examples to illustrate the concepts. A number of already marketed drugs, such as esmolol, remifentanil, or loteprednol etabonate, resulted from the successful application of such design principles.

A multidisciplinary approach, involving mathematical and computational modeling in parallel with experimentation, is often crucial for gaining such insights and improving the efficiency of artificial gene network design. Here we used such an approach and developed a combinatorial promoter design strategy to characterize how the position and multiplicity of tetO2 operator sites within the GAL1 promoter affect gene expression levels and gene expression noise in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We observed stronger transcriptional repression and higher gene expression noise as a single operator site was moved closer to the TATA box, whereas for multiple operator-containing promoters, we found that the position and number of operator sites together determined the dose–response curve and gene expression noise. We developed a generic computational model that captured the experimentally observed differences for each of the promoters, and more detailed models to successively predict the behavior of multiple operator-containing promoters from single operator-containing promoters. Our results suggest that the independent binding of single repressors is not sufficient to explain the more complex behavior of the multiple operator-containing promoters. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of joint experimental–computational efforts and some of the challenges of using a bottom-up approach based on well characterized, isolated biomolecular components for predicting the behavior of complex, synthetic gene networks, e.g., the whole can be different from the sum of its parts.",104,"Binding Sites; Computer Simulation; Gene Expression/genetics; Genetic Engineering/methods; Models, Biological; Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics; Repressor Proteins/metabolism",Repressor Proteins,http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007PNAS..10412726M http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1931564 http://www.pnas.org/content/104/31/12726 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1931564/ http://adatbank.transindex.ro/vendeg/htmlk/pdf7842.pdf http://collinslab.mit.edu/files/pnas_murphy.pdf http://www.pnas.org/content/104/31/12726.full.pdf,2,17652177,10.1073/pnas.0608451104,2008867005,PMC1931564

PowerBLAST was developed, in part, to address these problems. PowerBLAST includes a number of options for masking repetitive elements and low complexity subsequences. It also has the capacity to restrict the search to any level of NCBI’s taxonomy index, thus supporting “comparative genomics” applications. Postprocessing of the BLAST output using the SIM series of algorithms produces optimal, gapped alignments, and multiple alignments when a region of the query sequence matches multiple database sequences. PowerBLAST is capable of processing sequences of any length because it divides long query sequences into overlapping fragments and then merges the results after searching. The results may be viewed graphically, as a textual representation, or as an HTML page with links to GenBank and Entrez. For matching database sequences, annotated features are superimposed on the aligned query sequence in the output, thus greatly increasing the ease of interpretation. Such features may be used for automated annotation of new sequence because PowerBLAST output in ASN.1 form may be “dragged and dropped” into NCBI’s Sequin program for sequence annotation and submission.

In the present study, we investigated spontaneous intrachromosomal HR in mouse hybridoma cell lines in which variously numbered tandem repeats of the µ heavy chain constant (Cµ) region reside at the haploid, chromosomal immunoglobulin µ heavy chain locus. This organization provides the opportunity to investigate recombination between homologous gene repeats in a well-defined chromosomal locus under conditions in which recombinants are conveniently recovered. This system revealed several features about the mammalian intrachromosomal HR process: (i) the frequency of HR was high (recombinants represented as much as several percent of the total of recombinants and non-recombinants); (ii) the recombination process appeared to be predominantly non-reciprocal, consistent with the possibility of gene conversion; (iii) putative gene conversion tracts were long (up to 13.4 kb); (iv) the recombination process occurred with precision, initiating and terminating within regions of shared homology.

This is the first example of the secretion of such a large, heavily glycosylated heterologous protein in yeast. Since gp350 proved highly toxic to S. cerevisiae , initial cellular growth required repression of the expression of gp350. Using temperature- or galactose-inducible promoters, cells could be grown and the expression of gp350 then induced. After induction, the glycoprotein accumulated both intracellularly as well as in the culture medium. Only the most heavily glycosylated form was secreted, suggesting a role for N-linked glycans in directing secretion. The extent of O-linked glycosylation of the yeast-derived protein was similar to that of the mature viral gp350. N-linked glycosylation varied slightly depending upon culture conditions and host strain used and was more extensive than that associated with the mature viral gp350. Although there is no evidence that more than a single mRNA for the glycoprotein was expressed from the recombinant plasmid, variously sized glycoproteins accumulated in yeast at early stages after induction, probably reflecting intermediates in glycosylation. The yeast-derived glycoproteins reacted with animal and human polyclonal antibodies to gp350 as well as with a neutralizing murine monoclonal antibody to gp350, suggesting that this glycoprotein retains several epitopes of the native glycoprotein.",54,"Cloning, Molecular; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, Fungal; Genes, Viral; Glycoproteins/biosynthesis; Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics; Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis",Glycoproteins; Viral Envelope Proteins,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378111987903532 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/3038696 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3038696 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378111987903532,406,3038696,10.1016/0378-1119(87)90353-2,2088237438,

Initially, transcriptomic datasets were analysed to identify eight endogenous genes that exhibited high expression stability across four distinct CHO cell lines sampled in different culture phases. The relative transcript abundance of each gene in twenty diverse, commonly-applied experimental conditions was then determined by qPCR analysis. Utilizing GeNorm, BestKeeper, and NormFinder algorithms, we identified four mRNAs (Gnb1, Fkbp1a, Tmed2 and Mmadhc) that exhibited a highly stable level of expression across all conditions, validating their utility as universally-applicable reference genes. Whilst any combination of only two genes can be generally used for normalization of qPCR data, we show that specific combinations of reference genes are particularly suited to discrete experimental conditions.

In addition, the performed studies about structure-function relationship of the glycoproteins have shown that the oligosaccharide part of a glycoprotein confers important and specific biological roles. Thus, the modification of the structure of the glycan chains can lead to a modification of the activity of the glycoprotein.

Small volumes of aqueous buffer when injected into hexadecane take the form of droplets. These droplets when loaded with lipids assemble a lipid monolayer at the water/oil interface. By carefully touching two such monolayer encased aqueous droplets a bilayer can be formed which is conducive to the insertion of membrane proteins.Here we demonstrate that contacting two hydrogel surfaces coated with lipid monolayers can form a lipid bilayer, forming a so-called hydrogel interface bilayer (HIB). We use two of the most commonly available hydrogels, a natural polymer agarose and a synthetic polymer polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEG-DA), to form HIBs. The lipid bilayers formed using both the polymers are conducive to the insertion of membrane proteins as shown by the insertion of α-hemolysin pore.Thus far, solid-supported lipid bilayers for reconstituting membrane proteins have been assembled in a 2-D plane. We present a simple approach to form lipid monolayers on a manipulable 3-D system based on hydrogels. Millimeter sized particles were formed by using low melt agarose or PEG-diacrylate. Agarose and PEG-DA based hydrogels can be molded in different shapes and coated with a lipid monolayer, which on bringing together gives a lipid bilayer as monitored by an increase in the capacitance. Polymers molded in different shapes have been used in a number of applications ranging from reaction coding in enzyme catalysis to providing a 3-D environment for cell growth to drug delivery. We propose the use of such solid particles incorporating membrane pores for the use of constructing communicating electrical devices.",100,,,http://www.cell.com/article/S0006349510044449/abstract http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011BpJ...100..502S http://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(10)04444-9?scriptOff=true https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82334726.pdf,1,,10.1016/j.bpj.2010.12.2941,1982633393,

We constructed an expression plasmid containing a full length oryzacystatin cDNA at the multi-cloning site of pUC18 and produced a lacZ'-oryzacystatin fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The partially purified expressed protein efficiently inhibits papain activity assayed using N-benzoyl-DL-arginine-2-naphthylamide as a substrate. We also constructed expression plasmids lacking the 5'- and 3'-regions of cDNAs that encode NH2- and COOH-terminally truncated oryzacystatins. An N-truncated oryzacystatin lacking Gly5 and retaining Gln53-Val54-Val55-Ala56-Gly57 inhibited papain as efficiently as the full length oryzacystatin, although both Gly5 and Gln53-Gly57 (oryzacystatin numbering) are conserved among members of most cystatin superfamilies. However, another N-truncated oryzacystatin lacking the NH2-terminal 38 residues was almost completely inactive. On the other hand, a COOH-terminally truncated oryzacystatin lacking the COOH-terminal 11 residues possesses potent papain-inhibitory activity, whereas another COOH-terminally truncated oryzacystatin lacking 35 residues shows much less inhibitory activity, although it retains the two well conserved features Gly5 and Gln53-Gly57. These results indicate that the NH2-terminal 21 residues containing Gly5 and the COOH-terminal 11 residues are not essential, suggesting that a portion of the polypeptide segment containing Gln53-Gly57 is necessary for oryzacystatin to elicite its papain-inhibitory activity efficiently.",263,Amino Acid Sequence; Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors; DNA/metabolism; Escherichia coli/genetics; Gene Expression Regulation; Molecular Sequence Data; Papain/antagonists & inhibitors; Peptide Fragments/biosynthesis; Protease Inhibitors/biosynthesis; Structure-Activity Relationship,Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors; Peptide Fragments; Protease Inhibitors; DNA; Papain,http://www.jbc.org/content/263/16/7655.short http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3286638 http://www.jbc.org/content/263/16/7655.full.pdf,2,3286638,,1490183435,

However, it has been demonstrated that specific antibodies can be built by using an interface with a binary code consisting of only Tyr and Ser. This surprising result might be attributed to yet undefined properties of the antibody scaffold that uniquely enhance its capacity for target binding. In this work we tested the generality of the binary-code interface by engineering binding proteins based on a single-domain scaffold. We show that Tyr/Ser binary-code interfaces consisting of only 15–20 positions within a fibronectin type III domain (FN3; 95 residues) are capable of producing specific binding proteins (termed “monobodies”) with a low-nanomolar Kd. A 2.35-Å x-ray crystal structure of a monobody in complex with its target, maltose-binding protein, and mutation analysis revealed dominant contributions of Tyr residues to binding as well as striking molecular mimicry of a maltose-binding protein substrate, β-cyclodextrin, by the Tyr/Ser binary interface.

Brown; Bernie Sweeney; David O. Mainwaring; David C. James,"We describe for the first time the creation of a library of 140 synthetic promoters specifically designed to regulate the expression of recombinant genes in CHO cells. Initially, 10 common viral promoter sequences known to be active in CHO cells were analyzed using bioinformatic sequence analysis programs to determine the identity and relative abundance of transcription factor regulatory elements (TFREs; or transcription factor binding sites) they contained. Based on this, 28 synthetic reporters were constructed that each harbored seven repeats of a discrete TFRE sequence upstream of a minimal CMV core promoter element and secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene. After evaluation of the relative activity of TFREs by transient expression in CHO-S cells, we constructed a first generation library of 96 synthetic promoters derived from random ligation of six active TFREs inserted into the same reporter construct backbone. Comparison of the sequence and relative activity of first generation promoters revealed that individual TFRE blocks were either relatively abundant in active promoters (NFκB, E-box), equally distributed across promoters of varying activity (C/EBPα, GC-box) or relatively abundant in low activity promoters (E4F1, CRE). These data were utilized to create a second generation of 44 synthetic promoters based on random ligation of a fixed ratio of 4 TFREs (NFκB 5: E-box 3: C/EBPα 1: GC-box 1). Comparison of the sequence and relative activity of second generation promoters revealed that the most active promoters contained relatively high numbers of both NFκB and E-box TFREs in approximately equal proportion, with a correspondingly low number of GC-box and C/EBPα blocks. The most active second generation promoters achieved approximately twice the activity of a control construct harboring the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Lastly, we evaluated the function of a subset of synthetic promoters exhibiting a broad range of activity in different CHO cell host cell lines (CHO-S, CHO-K1, and CHO-DG44) and across extended fed-batch transient expression in CHO-S cells. In general, the different synthetic promoters both maintained their relative activity and the most active promoters consistently and significantly exceeded the activity of the CMV control promoter. For advanced cell engineering strategies our synthetic promoter libraries offer precise control of recombinant transcriptional activity in CHO cells spanning over two orders of magnitude. Biotechnol.

For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSIBLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities.

Because of the flexibility of DNA recognition by zinc fingers, these enzymes are potential tools for cleaving DNA at arbitrarily selected sequences. Efficient doublestrand cleavage by the chimeric nucleases requires two binding sites in close proximity. When cuts were mapped on the DNA strands, it was found that they occur in pairs separated by ∼ 4b p with a5 ′ overhang, as for native FokI. Furthermore, amino acid changes in the dimer interface of the cleavage domain abolished activity. These results reflect a requirement for dimerization of the cleavage domain. The dependence of cleavage efficiency on the distance between two inverted binding sites was determined and both upper and lower limits were defined. Two different zinc finger combinations binding to non-identical sites also supported specific cleavage. Molecular modeling was employed to gain insight into the precise location of the cut sites. These results define requirements for effective targets of chimeric nucleases and will guide the design of novel specificities for directed DNA cleavage in vitro and in vivo.",28,"Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Catalysis; DNA/genetics; DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry; Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific/chemistry; Dimerization; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation/genetics; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry; Substrate Specificity; Zinc Fingers","DNA-Binding Proteins; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; DNA; endodeoxyribonuclease FokI; Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific",http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/17/3361.full https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/28/17/3361/2912208 https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/requirements-for-double-strand-cleavage-by-chimeric-restriction-e-6 https://utah.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/requirements-for-double-strand-cleavage-by-chimeric-restriction-e https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC110700/ http://www.shutcm.com/shutcm/zyyjs/xsyd/wxsj/images/2006/12/18/3345.pdf,120,10954606,10.1093/nar/28.17.3361,2168357216,PMC110700

Specifically, whole-exome sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies is gaining popularity in the human genetics community due to the moderate costs, manageable data amounts and straightforward interpretation of analysis results. While whole-exome and, in the near future, whole-genome sequencing are becoming commodities, data analysis still poses significant challenges and led to the development of a plethora of tools supporting specific parts of the analysis workflow or providing a complete solution. Here, we surveyed 205 tools for whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing data analysis supporting five distinct analytical steps: quality assessment, alignment, variant identification, variant annotation and visualization. We report an overview of the functionality, features and specific requirements of the individual tools. We then selected 32 programs for variant identification, variant annotation and visualization, which were subjected to hands-on evaluation using four data sets: one set of exome data from two patients with a rare disease for testing identification of germline mutations, two cancer data sets for testing variant callers for somatic mutations, copy number variations and structural variations, and one semi-synthetic data set for testing identification of copy number variations.

The gene contained an open reading frame consisting of 1437 bp (479 amino acids). The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein showed little similarity with other known glycoside hydrolases. A signal sequence (20 amino acids) was found at the N-terminal region of the protein and the molecular mass of the mature form was calculated to be 50.488 kDa.

Joho; Lyndon Gross; Nancy J. McGraw; Curtis A. Raskin; William T. McAllister,"Bacteriophages T7 and T3 encode DNA-dependent RNA polymerases that are 82% homologous, yet exhibit a high degree of specificity for their own promoters. A region of the RNA polymerase gene (gene 1 ) that is responsible for this specificity has been localized using two approaches. First, the RNA polymerase genes of recombinant T7XT3 phage that had been generated in other laboratories in studies of phage polymerase specificity were characterized by restriction enzyme mapping. This approach localized the region that determines promoter specificity to the 3′ end of the polymerase gene, corresponding to the carboxyl end of the polymerase protein distal to amino acid 623. To define more closely the region of promoter specificity, a series of hybrid T7/T3 RNA polymerase genes was constructed by in vitro manipulation of the cloned genes. The specificity of the resulting hybrid RNA polymerases in vitro and in vivo indicates that an interval of the polymerase that spans amino acids 674 to 752 (the 674 to 752 interval) contains the primary determinant of promoter preference. Within this interval, the amino acid sequences of the T3 and T7 enzymes differ at only 11 out of 79 positions. It has been shown elsewhere that specific recognition of T3 and T7 promoters depends largely upon base-pairs in the region from −10 to −12. An analysis of the preference of the hybrid RNA polymerases for synthetic T7 promoter mutants indicates that the 674 to 752 interval is involved in identifying this region of the promoter, and suggests that another domain of the polymerase (which has not yet been identified) may be involved in identifying other positions where the two consensus promoter sequences differ (most notably at position −15).",215,"Amino Acid Sequence; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/genetics; Escherichia coli/enzymology; Genes, Viral; Molecular Sequence Data; Plasmids; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Restriction Mapping; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; T-Phages/enzymology",DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283605800920 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2204707 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283605800920,10,2204707,10.1016/s0022-2836(05)80092-0,1977661451,

Blaschek,"An overview of advances in acetone–butanol fermentation research is presented with specific reference to the history of acetone–butanol fermentation, genetic manipulation of the butanol-producing Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052, as well as upstream and downstream processing. Specific reference is made to the development of the hyperamylolytic, hyper-“butanolagenic” C. beijerinckii BA101 strain. Amylolytic enzyme production by C. beijerinckii BA101 was 1.8- and 2.5-fold greater than that of the C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 strain grown in starch and glucose, respectively. We confirmed the presence of a phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) associated with cell extracts of C. beijerinckii BA101 by glucose phosphorylation by PEP and ATP-dependent glucose phosphorylation. It was found that C. beijerinckii BA101 was defective in PTS activity and that it compensates for this defect with enhanced glucokinase activity, resulting in an ability to transport and utilize glucose during the solventogenic stage. The principal problem associated with acetone–butanol fermentation by C. beijerinckii or C. acetobutylicum is butanol toxicity/inhibition to the culture. To solve this problem, we have attempted various alternative in situ/online techniques of butanol removal including membrane-based systems such as pervaporation, liquid–liquid extraction, and gas stripping. We found that gas stripping and pervaporation appear to be the most promising of the in situ acetone–butanol fermentation and recovery techniques but, in terms of cost-effective industrial applications, gas stripping appears to be the most promising. © 2004 The Japan Chemical Journal Forum and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Cairns; Edward G. Saravolac; Lun-Quan Sun,"RNA, as an intermediate in the production of every gene encoded protein and the genetic material of many pathogenic viruses, presents an attractive target for both biological and therapeutic manipulation. Despite its extensive involvement in living systems, its chemical diversity based on four units is relatively low compared with protein. This provides the opportunity for a generic approach to targeting with specificity based on primary structure rather than complex higher order structures. This form of recognition occurs naturally in complementary nucleic acids, due to an ability to bind their single stranded target through Watson-Crick interactions. The most established nucleic acid based approach to gene suppression at the RNA level is through antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs). These compounds form heteroduplex with target RNA which are thought to either block its function or mediate its destruction by activation of RNase H. Alternatively, RNA can be targeted by catalytic RNA such as the hammerhead ribozyme. Ribozymes have the advantage of being equipped with their own RNA cleavage apparatus and are therefore independent of host nuclear protein activity. At present, the utility of ribozyme oligonucleotides is restricted by the relative difficulty synthesising active molecules with sufficient resistance to nuclease degradation. Recently the power of in vitro selection has been used to evolve catalytic DNA sequences with RNA cleavage specificity and activity rivalling the very best ribozymes, while maintaining the more robust chemistry of an ODN. These deoxyribozymes or DNAzymes have tremendous potential as gene suppression agents for both target validation and therapeutic applications. A number of studies evaluating the biological activity of these compounds have shown promising results. However, as with other oligonucleotide based strategies, future exploitation of this approach may depend on accessory technology to assist with the accessibility of a target which is folded by its own secondary structure and hidden within the intracellular compartment.",3,"Animals; Cell Line; DNA, Catalytic/administration & dosage; DNA, Single-Stranded/therapeutic use; Drug Carriers/chemistry; Drug Design; Drug Stability; Gene Targeting; Humans; RNA, Catalytic/therapeutic use; Suppression, Genetic","DNA, Catalytic; DNA, Single-Stranded; Drug Carriers; RNA, Catalytic; RNA-cleaving DNA 10-23; hammerhead ribozyme",http://benthamscience.com/journals/current-drug-targets/volume/3/issue/3/page/269/ http://www.eurekaselect.com/64243 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12041740,5,12041740,10.2174/1389450023347722,1634351,

Many different proteins, domains, or peptides can be fused with the target protein. The advantages of using fusion proteins to facilitate purification and detection of recombinant proteins are well-recognized. Nevertheless, it is difficult to choose the right purification system for a specific protein of interest. This review gives an overview of the most frequently used and interesting systems: Arg-tag, calmodulin-binding peptide, cellulose-binding domain, DsbA, c-myc-tag, glutathione S-transferase, FLAG-tag, HAT-tag, His-tag, maltose-binding protein, NusA, S-tag, SBP-tag, Strep-tag, and thioredoxin.",60,Amino Acid Sequence; Binding Sites; Calmodulin/chemistry; Carrier Proteins/chemistry; Cellulose/chemistry; Glutathione Transferase/chemistry; Histidine/chemistry; Industry; Maltose-Binding Proteins; Oligopeptides/chemistry; Peptide Fragments/chemical synthesis; Peptides/chemistry; Protein Binding; Protein Engineering; Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry; Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification; Ribonucleases/chemical synthesis,Ala-Trp-Arg-His-Pro-Gln-Phe-Gly-Gly; Calmodulin; Carrier Proteins; Maltose-Binding Proteins; Oligopeptides; Peptide Fragments; Peptides; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Recombinant Proteins; ribonuclease S-peptide; streptavidin-binding peptide; polyarginine; polyhistidine; Histidine; Cellulose; FLAG peptide; Glutathione Transferase; Ribonucleases,http://www.sid.ir/En/Journal/ViewPaper.aspx?ID=473558 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00253-002-1158-6 https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12536251 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00253-002-1158-6 http://web.mit.edu/dvp/Public/euj72wc9a8l23dtu.pdf http://wolfson.huji.ac.il/expression/local/tag-protein-fusions.pdf http://www.chem.ualberta.ca/~campbell/resources/Bioanalytical-2012/tag_protein_fusions.pdf,446,12536251,10.1007/s00253-002-1158-6,2114522205,

However, emerging TKI resistance prevents complete cure. Therefore, alternative strategies targeting regulatory modules of Bcr-Abl in addition to the kinase active site are strongly desirable. Here, we show that an intramolecular interaction between the SH2 and kinase domains in Bcr-Abl is both necessary and sufficient for high catalytic activity of the enzyme. Disruption of this interface led to inhibition of downstream events critical for CML signaling and, importantly, completely abolished leukemia formation in mice. Furthermore, disruption of the SH2-kinase interface increased sensitivity of imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl mutants to TKI inhibition. An engineered Abl SH2-binding fibronectin type III monobody inhibited Bcr-Abl kinase activity both in vitro and in primary CML cells, where it induced apoptosis.

Human mesenchymal stem cells and MG-63 cells were encapsulated into agarose hydrogels, and subsequently printed in high aspect ratio in three dimensional structures that were supported in high density fluorocarbon. Three-dimensional structures with various shapes and sizes were manufactured and remained stable for more than six months.

The classes of species analyzed include the bacterium Escherichia coli (ECO), the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (YSC), the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (DRO), and several species of primates (PRI) (taken as a group; includes eleven species for which nucleotide sequence data have been reported to GenBank, however, greater than 90% of the sequences were from Homo sapiens ). The number of protein-coding sequences analyzed were 968 for ECO, 484 for YSC, 244 for DRO, and 1518 for PRI. Three methods have been used to determine low-usage codons in these species. The first and most common way of assessing codon usage is by summing the number of time codons appear in reading frames of the genome in question. The second way is to examine the distribution of usage in different genes by scoring the number of protein reading frames in which a particular codon does not appear. The third way starts with a similar notion, but instead considers combinations of codons that are missing from the maximum number of genes. These three methods give very similar results. Each species has a unique combination of eight least-used codons, but all species contain the arginine codons, CGA and CGG. The agreement between YSC and PRI is particularly striking as they share six low-usage codons. All six carry the dinucleotide sequence, CG. The eight least-used codons in PRI include all codons that contain the CG dinucleotide sequence. Low-usage codons are clearly avoided in genes encoding abundant proteins for ECO, YSC and DRO. In all species, proteins containing a high percentage of low-usage codons could be characterized as cases where an excess of the protein could be detrimental. Low codon usage is relatively insensitive to gross base composition. However, dinucleotide usage can sometimes influence codon usage. This is particularly notable in the case of CG dinucleotides in PRI.",105,Animals; Base Composition/genetics; Codon/genetics; Dinucleoside Phosphates/genetics; Drosophila melanogaster/genetics; Escherichia coli/genetics; Gene Expression Regulation/genetics; Hominidae/genetics; Humans; Open Reading Frames/genetics; Primates/genetics; Proteins/genetics; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics,Codon; Dinucleoside Phosphates; Proteins,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1937008 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037811199190514C#!,51,1937008,10.1016/0378-1119(91)90514-c,2012456489,

In particular, this new assembly pathway allows dodecahedral shells to form readily, whereas these structures never form in the absence of the template. Secondly, we consider the self-assembly of multi-shell structures, where the central icosahedral core is known to form readily on its own, and which could then template the growth of further layers.

However, this approach suffers from intrinsic limitations, such as the inability to target areas within deep tissues, due mainly to a strong decrease of the magnetic field magnitude away from the magnets. Magnetic resonance navigation (MRN) involving the endovascular steering of therapeutic magnetic microcarriers (TMMC) represents a clinically viable alternative to reach deep tissues. MRN is achieved with an upgraded magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. In this proof-of-concept preclinical study, the preparation and steering of TMMC which were designed by taking into consideration the constraints of MRN and liver chemoembolization are reported. TMMC were biodegradable microparticles loaded with iron-cobalt nanoparticles and doxorubicin (DOX). These particles displayed high saturation magnetization (Ms = 72 emu g −1 ), MRI tracking compatibility (strong contrast on T2∗-weighted images), appropriate size for the blood vessel embolization (∼50 μm), and sustained release of DOX (over several days). The TMMC were successfully steered in vitro and in vivo in the rabbit model. In vivo targeting of the right or left liver lobes was achieved by MRN through the hepatic artery located 4 cm beneath the skin. Parameters such as flow velocity, TMMC release site in the artery, magnetic gradient and TMMC properties, affected the steering efficiency.

A synthetic gene was constructed and recombinantly expressed. Surprisingly, consensus phytase-1 was 15–26°C more thermostable than all parent phytases used in its design [Lehmann et al. (2000) Protein Eng., 13, 49–57]. In the present study, inclusion of six further phytase sequences in the amino acid sequence alignment resulted in the replacement of 38 amino acid residues in either one or both of the new consensus phytases-10 and -11. Since consensus phytase10, again, was 7.4°C more thermostable than consensus phytase-1, the thermostability effects of most of the 38 amino acid substitutions were tested by site-directed mutagenesis. Both stabilizing and destabilizing mutations were identified, but all affected the stability of the enzyme by <3°C. The combination of all stabilizing amino acid exchanges in a multiple mutant of consensus phytase-1 increased the unfolding temperature from 78.0 to 88.5°C. Likewise, back-mutation of four destabilizing amino acids and introduction of an additional stabilizing amino acid in consensus phytase-10 further increased the unfolding temperature from 85.4 to 90.4°C. The thermostabilization achieved is the result of a combination of slight improvements from multiple amino acid exchanges rather than being the effect of a single or of just a few dominating mutations that have been introduced by chance. The present findings support the general validity of the consensus concept for thermostability engineering of proteins.",15,"6-Phytase/chemistry; Amino Acid Sequence; Enzyme Stability; Fungal Proteins/chemistry; Hot Temperature; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Pichia/enzymology; Protein Engineering; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/chemistry; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, Protein",Fungal Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; 6-Phytase,http://paperity.org/p/41898766/the-consensus-concept-for-thermostability-engineering-of-proteins-further-proof-of http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/5/403.abstract https://academic.oup.com/peds/article/15/5/403/1508278/The-consensus-concept-for-thermostability https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12034860,28,12034860,10.1093/protein/15.5.403,2125214592,

The substrate saturation constant (K-s) of a reference strain was about 15 mu M in glucose-limited chemostat culture. Disruption of mstA resulted in a two- to fivefold reduction in affinity for glucose and led to expression of a low-affinity glucose transport gene, mstC, at high dilution rate. The effect of mstA disruption was more subtle at low and intermediate dilution rates, pointing to some degree of functional redundancy in the high-affinity uptake system of A. niger. The mstA disruptant and a reference strain were cultivated in glucose-limited chemostat cultures at low, intermediate and high dilution rate (D=0.07 h(-1), 0.14 h(-1) and 0.20 h(-1)). Mycelium harvested from steady-state cultures was subjected to glucose uptake assays, and analysed for expression of mstA and two other transporter genes, mstC and mstF The capacity for glucose uptake (V-max) of both strains was significantly reduced at low dilution rate. The glucose uptake assays revealed complex uptake kinetics. This impeded accurate determination of maximum specific uptake rates (V-max) and apparent affinity constants (K-m(app)) at intermediate and high dilution rate. Two high-affinity glucose transporter genes, mstA and mstF, were expressed at all three dilution rates in chemostat cultures, in contrast to batch culture, where only mstC was expressed.

The plastic deformations produced by tearing define a new metric on the sheet, which then relaxes elastically. The resultant patterns of wrinkles correspond to a superposition of waves of different wavelengths. Measurements of the variation of the pattern as a function of the distance from the edge reveal a set of transitions, each of which adds a new mode to the cascade. The wavelengths lambda in the cascade depend on both a geometrical length scale Lgeo given by the metric near the sheet's edge, and the sheet thickness t: lambda proportional t0.3Lgeo0.7. This scaling implies vanishingly short wavelengths in the limit t-->0 . A possible geometrical origin of this behavior is discussed. Finally, we show that our measurement and analysis techniques are applicable to the study of some wavy patterns of leaves. These measurements reveal that the intrinsic geometry of a wavy leaf resembles that of the torn plastic sheets. This supports the possibility that some leaves form waves through a spontaneous wrinkling, rather than through an explicit three-dimensional construction.",75,,,,1,17500982,,,

The so-called oil crisis in 1973 led to renewed interest in novel fermentation and product recovery technologies as well as in the metabolism and genetics of the bacterial species involved. As a consequence, almost all of the enzymes leading to solvent formation are known, their genes have been sequenced (in fact, Clostridium acetobutylicum has been recently included in the microbial genome sequencing project), the regulatory mechanisms controlling solventogenesis have begun to emerge and recombinant DNA techniques have been developed for these clostridia to construct specific production strains. In parallel, cheap agricultural-waste-based feedstocks have been exploited for their potential as novel substrates, continuous culture methods have been successfully established and new on-line product recovery technologies are now available, such as gas stripping, liquid/liquid extraction, and membrane-based methods.

The purification has been carried out in a five-step procedure comprising chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex, gel filtration on polyacrylamide P-150, activation on a Dowex 2-X8 anion exchanger, chromatography on Concanavalin A-Sepharose and chromatography on SP-Sephadex. The purified enzyme was found to be pure and homogeneous by analytical polyacrylamide electrophoresis, by electrophoresis on dodecylsulphate gels and by analytical polyacrylamide electrophoresis, by electrophoresis on dodecylsulphate gels and by analytical isoelectric focusing. A single symmetrical peak was obtained with the free zone electrophoresis method. The purification factor is about 15 and the yield of exo-1,4-beta-glucanase activity 7%. After purification, the enzyme showed no viscosity-decreasing activity towards carboxymethyl-cellulose solutions. The exo-1,4-beta-glucanase was isoelectric at pH 4.3 (4 degrees C). A molecular weight of 48600 was calculated on the basis of a knowledge of the partial specific volume, ultracentrifugation data and the amino acid composition.

Espeso; Joan Tilburn; Herbert N. Arst; Miguel A. Peñalva,"Abstract; Transcription of the ipnA gene encoding isopenicillin N synthetase, an enzyme of secondary metabolism, is under the control of the pH regulatory system in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans. External alkaline pH or mutations in pacC, the wide domain regulatory gene which mediates pH regulation, override carbon regulation of ipnA transcript levels, resulting in elevation of the levels of this message in sucrose broth. Strains carrying these mutations, which mimic growth at alkaline pH, produce higher levels of penicillins when grown in sucrose broth compared with the wild type strain grown under carbon derepressing conditions. ipnA transcription is regulated by carbon (C) source, but extreme mutations in creA (the regulatory gene mediating carbon catabolite repression) only slightly increase repressed transcript levels. Precise deletion of the only in vitro CreA binding site present in a region of the ipnA promoter involved in carbon regulation has no effect on ipnA expression. The levels of ipnA transcript in broths with acetate or glycerol as principal C sources are inconsistent with direct or indirect creA-mediated transcriptional control of the gene. We conclude that a second, creA-independent mechanism of carbon repression controls expression of this gene. All derepressing C sources tested result in alkalinization of the growth media. In contrast, all repressing C sources result in external acidification. Neither acidic external pH nor pal mutations, mimicking the effects of growth at acid pH, prevent carbon derepression, providing strong support for independent regulatory mechanisms, one mediating carbon regulation (via thus far unidentified genes) and another mediating pH regulation (through the pacC-encoded transcriptional regulator). External pH measurements suggest that these two independent forms of regulation normally act in concert. We propose that external alkalinity represents a physiological signal which triggers penicillin biosynthesis.",12,"Acetates/metabolism; Aspergillus nidulans/enzymology; Base Sequence; Carbon/metabolism; DNA, Fungal; Fungal Proteins/metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Genes, Fungal; Genes, Regulator; Glycerol/metabolism; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Oxidoreductases/genetics; Penicillins/biosynthesis; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Repressor Proteins/metabolism; Transcription, Genetic","Acetates; DNA, Fungal; Fungal Proteins; Penicillins; Repressor Proteins; CreA protein, Aspergillus nidulans; Carbon; Oxidoreductases; isopenicillin N synthetase; Glycerol",http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8404862 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC413677 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC413677/,4,8404862,10.1002/j.1460-2075.1993.tb06072.x,171932459,PMC413677

Cistola,"Abstract; The net transfer of oleic acid between egg phosphatidylcholine unilamellar vesicles and bovine serum albumin has been monitored by 13C NMR spectroscopy and 90% isotopically substituted [1-13C]oleic acid. The carboxyl chemical shifts of oleic acid bound to albumin were different from those for oleic acid in phospholipid vesicles. Therefore, in mixtures of donor particles (vesicles or albumin with oleic acid) and acceptor particles (fatty acid-free albumin or vesicles), the equilibrium distribution of oleic acid was determined from chemical shift and peak intensity data without separation of donor and acceptor particles. In a system containing equal masses of albumin and phospholipid and a stoichiometry of 4-5 mol of oleic acid per mol of albumin, the oleic acid distribution was pH dependent, with greater than or equal to 80% of the oleic acid associated with albumin at pH 7.4; association was greater than or equal to 90% at pH 8.0. Decreasing the pH below 7.4 markedly decreased the proportion of fatty acid bound to albumin; at pH 5.4, less than or equal to 10% of the oleic acid was bound to albumin and greater than 90% was associated with vesicles. The distribution was reversible with pH and was independent of whether vesicles or albumin acted as a donor. These data suggest that pH may strongly influence the partitioning of fatty acid between cellular membranes and albumin. The 13C NMR method is also advantageous because it provides information about the structural environments of oleic acid bound to albumin or phospholipid, the ionization state of oleic acid in each environment, and the structural integrity of the vesicles. In addition, minimum and maximum limits for the exchange rates of oleic acid among different environments were obtained from the NMR data.",83,"Fatty Acids/metabolism; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Liposomes/metabolism; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Oleic Acid; Oleic Acids/metabolism; Phosphatidylcholines/metabolism; Serum Albumin, Bovine/metabolism","Fatty Acids; Liposomes; Oleic Acids; Phosphatidylcholines; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Oleic Acid",http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/3455761 http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986PNAS...83...82H http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC322795 http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.83.1.82 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC322795/ http://www.pnas.org/content/83/1/82.full.pdf,5,3455761,10.1073/pnas.83.1.82,2056377090,PMC322795

Batch fermentations at pH 4.5, 5.5, or 6.5 were conducted using C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 (pFNK6). Plasmid pFNK6 contains a synthetic operon (the “ace operon”) in which the three homologous acetone-formation genas (adc, ctfA, and ctfB) are transcribed from the adc promoter. The corresponding enzymes (acetoacetate decarboxylase and CoA-transferase) were best expressed in pH 4.5 fermentations. However, the highest levels of solvents were attained at pH 5.5. Relative to the plasmid-free control strain at pH 5.5, ATCC 824 (pFNK6) produced 95%, 37%, and 90% higher final concentrations of acetone, butanol, and ethanol, respectively; a 50% higher yield (g/g) of solvents on glucose; and a 22-fold lower mass of residual carboxylic acids. At all pH values, the acetone-formation enzymes were expressed earlier with ATCC 824 (pFNK6) than in control fermentations, leading to earlier induction of acetone formation. Furthermore, strain ATCC 824 (pFNK6) produced butanol significantly earlier in the fermentation and produced significant levels of solvents at pH 6.5. Only trace levels of solvents were produced by strain ATCC 824 at pH 6.5. Compared with ATCC 824, a plasmid-control strain containing a vector without the ace operon also produced higher levels of solvents [although lower than those of strain ATCC 824 (pFNK6)] and lower levels of acids. Strains containing plasmid-borne derivatives of the ace operon, in which either the acetoacetate decarboxylase or CoA-transferase alone were expressed at elevated levels, produced acids and solvents at levels similar to those of the plasmid-control strain. © 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",42,,,http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/bit.260420906 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.260420906/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18613233,22,18613233,10.1002/bit.260420906,2163257220,

Chalcones are synthesized from tyrosine and phenylalanine via the phenylpropanoid pathway involving phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase (4CL), and chalcone synthase (CHS). For the purpose of production of flavanones in Escherichia coli, three sets of an artificial gene cluster which contained three genes of heterologous origins—PAL from the yeast Rhodotorula rubra, 4CL from the actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), and CHS from the licorice plant Glycyrrhiza echinata—were constructed. The constructions of the three sets were done as follows: (i) PAL, 4CL, and CHS were placed in that order under the control of the T7 promoter (PT7) and the ribosome-binding sequence (RBS) in the pET vector, where the initiation codons of 4CL and CHS were overlapped with the termination codons of the preceding genes; (ii) the three genes were transcribed by a single PT7 in front of PAL, and each of the three contained the RBS at appropriate positions; and (iii) all three genes contained both PT7 and the RBS. These pathways bypassed C4H, a cytochrome P-450 hydroxylase, because the bacterial 4CL enzyme ligated coenzyme A to both cinnamic acid and 4-coumaric acid. E. coli cells containing the gene clusters produced two flavanones, pinocembrin from phenylalanine and naringenin from tyrosine, in addition to their precursors, cinnamic acid and 4-coumaric acid. Of the three sets, the third gene cluster conferred on the host the highest ability to produce the flavanones.

Oligodeoxyribonucleotides complementary to positions 582 to 593 of the viral DNA strand of the bacteriophage phiX174 am3 mutant (pGTATCCTACAAA), and to the wild type sequence in this region (pGTATCCTACAAA), were synthesized and used as specific mutagens. Each of these oligonucleotides was incorporated into a complete circular complementary strand when used as primer on a genetically heterologous viral strand template, by the combined action of subtilisin-treated Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and T4 DNA ligase. Incomplete duplexes were removed or were inactivated by nuclease S1 and the products were used to transfect spheroplasts of E. coli. Both oligonucleotides induced specific mutations at high efficiency when used with heterologous template (15% mutants among progeny phage). The am phages isolated by this procedure are phenotypically gene E mutants, and contain A at position 587 of the viral strand. They thus appear identical with am3 and provide evidence that the change G leads to A at position 587 is sufficient to produce a defective E function. Since the template for the induction of am mutants carried another genetic marker (sB1), the strains carrying the induced mutations have the new genotype am3 sB1. It should be possible to introduce the am3 mutation into any known mutant strain of phi174 using this same oligonucleotide. Both possible transition mutations were induced in these experiments. In principle, the method could also induce transversions, insertions, and deletions. The method should be applicable to other circular DNAs of similar size, for example recombinant DNA plasmids.",253,"Base Sequence; Coliphages/genetics; DNA, Viral/genetics; Mutagens; Mutation; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemical synthesis; Oligonucleotides/pharmacology; Templates, Genetic","DNA, Viral; Mutagens; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides; Oligonucleotides",http://www.jbc.org/content/253/18/6551.abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/681366,113,681366,,1594663644,

Mills; David Needham,"The enhanced permeability of lipid bilayer membranes at their gel-to-liquid phase transition has been explained using a ‘‘bilayer lipid heterogeneity’’ model, postulating leaky interfacial regions between still solid and melting liquid phases. The addition of lysolipid to dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers dramatically enhances the amount of, and speed at which, encapsulated markers or drugs are released at this, already leaky, phase transition through these interfacial regions. To characterize and attempt to determine the mechanism behind lysolipidgenerated permeability enhancement, dithionite permeability and doxorubicin release were measured for lysolipid and non-lysolipid, containing membranes. Rapid release of contents from lysolipid-containing membranes appears to occur through lysolipid-stabilized pores rather than a simple enhancement due to increased drug solubility in the bilayer. A dramatic enhancement in the permeability rate constant begins about two degrees below the calorimetric peak of the thermal transition, and extends several degrees past it. The maximum permeability rate constant coincides exactly with this calorimetric peak. Although some lysolipid desorption from liquid state membranes cannot be dismissed, dialyzation above Tm and mass spectrometry analysis indicate lysolipid must, and can, remain in the membrane for the permeability enhancement, presumably in lysolipid stabilized pores in the grain boundary regions of the partially melted solid phase.

Due to their important biological and pathological functions, the biosynthesis, activation, transfer, breaking down, and recycle of sialic acids are attracting increasing attention. The understanding of the sialic acid metabolism in eukaryotes and bacteria leads to the development of metabolic engineering approaches for elucidating the important functions of sialic acid in mammalian systems and for large-scale production of sialosides using engineered bacterial cells. As the key enzymes in biosynthesis of sialylated structures, sialyltransferases have been continuously identified from various sources and characterized. Protein crystal structures of seven sialyltransferases have been reported. Wild-type sialyltransferases and their mutants have been applied with or without other sialoside biosynthetic enzymes for producing complex sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates.

The axhD3 gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Several substrates were employed in the biochemical characterization of recombinant AXHd3. The enzyme showed the highest activity toward wheat arabinoxylan oligosaccharides. In addition, β-xylanase from Trichoderma sp. was able to degrade soluble wheat arabinoxylan polymer to a higher extent, after pretreatment with recombinant AXHd3.

The reason for these discrepancies is not clear, but given that most methods involve PCR, the prime suspect is PCR artifacts (e.g. spontaneous errors by the DNA polymerases used). In addition to simple misincorporation, another important source of artificial mutations is the conversion of chemically modified (e.g. damaged) nucleotides into mutations when bypassed by a thermostable DNA polymerase. These latter mutations are particularly difficult to account for because appropriate controls are not available. Here, we argue that single molecule PCR (smPCR) is uniquely positioned to account for these bypass-related artificial mutations and discuss the methodology involved in employing this technique.",46,"Artifacts; Cloning, Molecular/methods; DNA Damage/genetics; DNA Mutational Analysis/methods; DNA, Mitochondrial/genetics; Mutation/genetics; Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods","DNA, Mitochondrial",http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/18955147 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202308001874 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2654379 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18955147 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202308001874,6,18955147,10.1016/j.ymeth.2008.10.005,2016973834,

In a mutant yeast strain with the main seven hexose transporter genes deleted, and engineered for xylose utilization, we screened an expression cDNA library of the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) for enhanced growth on xylose plates. One cDNA clone with significant homology to fungal sugar transporters was obtained, but when the clone was retransformed into the host, it did not support significant growth on xylose. However, during a long liquid culture of the strain carrying the cDNA clone, adaptive mutations apparently occurred in the host, which led to growth on xylose but not on glucose. The new transporter homologue, Trxlt1 thus appears to code for a protein specific for xylose uptake. In addition, xylose-transporting properties of some homologous hexose transporters were studied. All of them, i.e., Hxt1, Hxt2, Hxt4, and Hxt7 were capable of xylose uptake. Their affinities for xylose varied, K m values between 130 and 900 mM were observed. The single-Hxt strains showed a biphasic growth mode on xylose, alike the Trxlt1 harboring strain.

This technology can accelerate research in functional proteomics and enable biologists to carry out multiplexed protease inhibitor screens on a large scale. The assay readout is based on Illuminas universal Sentrix® BeadArrays. The peptide sequences that serve as protease substrates are conjugated to oligonucleotide sequences complementary to the oligo tags on randomly assembled and decoded bead arrays. The peptide portion is C-terminally labeled with a biotin residue and contains a sequence of five histidine residues on the amino terminus. The unique oligonucleotide part of each oligonucleotide-peptide conjugate is attached to amino terminus of the peptide sequence. Upon protease cleavage, the biotin residue is cleaved from the oligonucleotide-peptide conjugate. Following the reaction, all biotin-containing species are captured and removed by incubation with streptavidin beads. The cleaved conjugates that remain in solution are captured by hybridization of their oligo sequence to Sentrix BeadArrays and detected using a labeled antibody against pentahistidine tag of the conjugate or by an antibody sandwich assay. We have generated multiple sets of oligonucleotide tagged peptide substrates of varying complexity (100 to 1000 substrates in a mixture) and show that the response of individual substrate is independent of the complexity of the mixture.

One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array.

These diseases develop in people bearing one mutant and one wild-type gene allele. While the mutant is toxic, the wild-type performs important functions. Thus, the ideal therapy must selectively silence the mutant but maintain the wild-type expression. To achieve this goal, we designed an shRNA that selectively silenced a mutant Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1G93A) allele that causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the efficacy of this shRNA was relatively modest. Since the allele-specific shRNA has to target the mutation site, we could not scan other regions of SOD1 mRNA to find the best silencer. To overcome this problem, we sought to increase the dose of this shRNA by enhancing the Pol III promoter. Here we demonstrate that the enhancer from the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter can enhance the U6 promoter activity, the synthesis of shRNA and the efficacy of RNA interference (RNAi). Thus, this enhanced U6 promoter is useful where limited choices of shRNA sequences preclude the selection of a highly efficient RNAi target region.",31,"Base Sequence; Blotting, Northern; Blotting, Western; Cell Line; Cytomegalovirus/genetics; Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Humans; Luminescent Proteins/genetics; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics; RNA Interference; RNA, Messenger/genetics; RNA, Small Interfering/chemistry; RNA, Small Nuclear/genetics; Superoxide Dismutase/genetics; Transfection","Luminescent Proteins; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Small Interfering; RNA, Small Nuclear; U6 small nuclear RNA; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Superoxide Dismutase",http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC212820 http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/17/e100.full.pdf https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/31/17/e100/1192867 https://escholarship.umassmed.edu/oapubs/1697/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC212820/ http://escholarship.umassmed.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2696&context=oapubs,36,12930974,10.1093/nar/gng098,1988183618,PMC212820

We cloned the dehydrogenase from Humicola insolens, which encodes a protein of 761 amino acid residues containing an N-terminal heme domain and a C-terminal flavin domain, and studied how the catalyzed electron transfers are regulated. Based on the correlation between the rate and redox potential, we demonstrated that with a reduced flavin center, the enzyme, as a reductase, could export electron from its heme center by a ""outer-sphere"" mechanism. With the ""resting"" flavin center, however, the enzyme could have a peroxidase-like function and import electron to its heme center after a peroxidative activation. The dual functionality of its heme center makes the enzyme a molecular ""logic gate"", in which the electron flow through the heme center can be switched in direction by the redox state of the coupled flavin center.",28,,,,7,11397454,10.1016/s0141-0229(01)00319-2,,

Schatz,"During lymphocyte development, V(D)J recombination assembles antigen receptor genes from component V, D, and J gene segments. These gene segments are flanked by a recombination signal sequence (RSS), which serves as the binding site for the recombination machinery. The murine Jβ2.6 gene segment is a recombinationally inactive pseudogene, but examination of its RSS reveals no obvious reason for its failure to recombine. Mutagenesis of the Jβ2.6 RSS demonstrates that the sequences of the heptamer, nonamer, and spacer are all important. Strikingly, changes solely in the spacer sequence can result in dramatic differences in the level of recombination. The subsequent analysis of a library of more than 4,000 spacer variants revealed that spacer residues of particular functional importance are correlated with their degree of conservation. Biochemical assays indicate distinct cooperation between the spacer and heptamer/nonamer along each step of the reaction pathway. The results suggest that the spacer serves not only to ensure the appropriate distance between the heptamer and nonamer but also regulates RSS activity by providing additional RAG:RSS interaction surfaces. We conclude that while RSSs are defined by a “digital” requirement for absolutely conserved nucleotides, the quality of RSS function is determined in an “analog” manner by numerous complex interactions between the RAG proteins and the less-well conserved nucleotides in the heptamer, the nonamer, and, importantly, the spacer. Those modulatory effects are accurately predicted by a new computational algorithm for “RSS information content.” The interplay between such binary and multiplicative modes of interactions provides a general model for analyzing protein–DNA interactions in various biological systems.",1,"Algorithms; Animals; Cell Line; Cloning, Molecular; Computational Biology/methods; DNA/chemistry; DNA, Intergenic; Humans; Lymphocytes/metabolism; Mice; Models, Genetic; Models, Statistical; Mutagenesis; Oligonucleotides/chemistry; Plasmids/metabolism; Protein Binding; Protein Sorting Signals; Recombination, Genetic; Software; T-Lymphocytes/immunology; VDJ Recombinases/physiology","DNA, Intergenic; Oligonucleotides; Protein Sorting Signals; DNA; VDJ Recombinases",http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0000001 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC212687 http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0000001 http://paperity.org/p/61122293/a-functional-analysis-of-the-spacer-of-v-d-j-recombination-signal-sequences http://www.plosbiology.org/article/fetchSingleRepresentation.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0000001.st002 https://utsouthwestern.influuent.utsystem.edu/en/publications/a-functional-analysis-of-the-spacer-of-vdj-recombination-signal-s https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14551903,7,14551903,10.1371/journal.pbio.0000001,2022372517,

The yield of transformants increased linearly up to 5 μg plasmid per transformation. A 20-min heat shock at 42°C was necessary for maximal yields. PEG was found to deposit both carrier DNA and plasmid DNA onto cells. SS carrier DNA bound more effectively to the cells and caused tighter binding of 32P-labelled plasmid DNA than did double-stranded (DS) carrier. The LiAc/SS-DNA/PEG transformation method did not result in cell fusion. DS carrier DNA competed with DS vector DNA in the transformation reaction. SS plasmid DNA transformed cells poorly in combination with both SS and DS carrier DNA.

James,"One of the most significant problems in industrial bioprocessing of recombinant proteins using engineered mammalian cells is the phenomenon of cell line instability, where a production cell line suffers a loss of specific productivity (qP). This phenomenon occurs with unpredictable kinetics and has been widely observed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines and with all commonly used gene expression systems. The underlying causes (both genetic and physiological) and the precise molecular mechanisms underpinning cell line instability have yet to be fully elucidated, although recombinant gene silencing and loss of recombinant gene copies have been shown to cause qP loss. In this work we have investigated the molecular mechanisms underpinning qP instability over long-term sub-culture in CHO cell lines producing recombinant IgG1 and IgG2 monoclonal antibodies (Mab's). We demonstrate that production instability derives from two primary mechanisms: (i) epigenetic—methylation-induced transcriptional silencing of the CMV promoter driving Mab gene transcription and (ii) genetic—progressive loss of recombinant Mab gene copies in a proliferating CHO cell population. We suggest that qP decline resulting from loss of recombinant genes is a consequence of the inherent genetic instability of recombinant CHO cell lines. Biotechnol.

We now sought to use the backbone of consensus phytase-1 and to modify its catalytic properties. This was done by replacing a considerable part of the active site (i.e., all the divergent residues) with the corresponding residues of Aspergillus niger NRRL 3135 phytase, which displays pronounced differences in specific activity, substrate specificity, and pH-activity profile. For the new protein termed consensus phytase-7, a major - although not complete - shift in catalytic properties was observed, demonstrating that rational transfer of favorable catalytic properties from one phytase to another is possible by using this approach. Although the exchange of the active site was associated with a 7.6 degrees C decrease in unfolding temperature (Tm) as measured by differential scanning calorimetry, consensus phytase-7 still was >7 degrees C more thermostable than all wild-type ascomycete phytases known to date. Thus, combination of the consensus approach with the selection of a ""preferred"" active site allows the design of a thermostabilized variant of an enzyme family of interest that (most closely) matches the most favorable catalytic properties found among its family members.",9,"6-Phytase/chemistry; Amino Acid Sequence; Amino Acid Substitution; Aspergillus niger/enzymology; Binding Sites; Consensus Sequence; DNA Primers; Enzyme Stability; Escherichia coli; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Protein Conformation; Recombinant Proteins/chemistry; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Thermodynamics",DNA Primers; Recombinant Proteins; 6-Phytase,http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0961836800995063 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2144468 http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0961836800995063 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1110/ps.9.10.1866/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2144468/,36,11106158,10.1110/ps.9.10.1866,2167001977,PMC2144468

For large genetic programs, keeping track of the DNA on the level of nucleotides becomes tedious and error prone, requiring a new generation of computer-aided design (CAD) software. To push the size of projects, it is important to abstract the designer from the process of part selection and optimization. The vision is to specify genetic programs in a higher-level language, which a genetic compiler could automatically convert into a DNA sequence. Steps towards this goal include: defining the semantics of the higher-level language, algorithms to select and assemble parts, and biophysical methods to link DNA sequence to function. These will be coupled to graphic design interfaces and simulation packages to aid in the prediction of program dynamics, optimize genes, and scan projects for errors.",21,Automation; DNA/biosynthesis; Systems Biology,DNA,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166910001242 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20702081 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166910001242,1,20702081,10.1016/j.copbio.2010.07.005,2078444049,

Although efforts have been focused on the development of newer therapeutic agents by chemical synthesis, to our knowledge, there has been no attempt to harness the potential of microorganisms for this purpose. Escherichia coli affords a widely studied cellular system that could be utilized not only for understanding but also for attempting to engineer the biosynthetic pathway of secondary metabolites. The primary metabolic pathway of E. coli can be engineered to divert the precursor pool required for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Utilizing this approach previously, we engineered E. coli host and generated E. coli M1. Here, we produced a ribostamycin derivative in the engineered host by heterologous expression of the recombinants constructed from the genes encoding the biosynthetic pathway in aminoglycoside-producing strains.

Here, we describe five new STM-based scaffold proteins that contain modifications designed to further improve the versatility of our scaffold. In a step-by-step approach, we introduced restriction sites in the STM open reading frame that generated new peptide insertion sites in loop 1, loop 2 and the N-terminus of the scaffold protein. A second restriction site in ‘loop 2’ allows substitution of the native loop 2 sequence with alternative oligopeptides. None of the amino acid changes interfered significantly with the folding of the STM variants as assessed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Of the five scaffold variants tested, one (stefin A quadruple mutant, SQM) was chosen as a versatile, stable scaffold. The insertion of epitope tags at varying positions showed that inserts into loop 1, attempted here for the first time, were generally well tolerated.

However, phytocystatins are generally poor inhibitors of the cysteine protease, bromelain, of pineapple (Ananas comosus). Here, we demonstrated that pineapple cystatin, AcCYS1, inhibited (>95%) stem and fruit bromelain. AcCYS1 is a unique cystatin in that it contains an extended N-terminal trunk (NTT) of 63 residues rich in alanine and glutamate. A signal peptide preceding the NTT is processed in vitro by microsomal membranes giving rise to a 27-kD species. AcCYS1 mRNA was present in roots and leaves but was most abundant in fruit. Using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy with an AcCYS1-specific antiserum, AcCYS1 was found in the apoplasm. Immunoblot analysis identified a 27-kD protein in fruit, roots, and leaves and a 15-kD species in mature ripe fruit. Ripe fruit extracts proteolytically removed the NTT of 27-kD AcCYS1 in vitro to produce the 15-kD species. Mass spectrometry analysis was used to map the primary cleavage site immediately after a conserved critical glycine-94. The AE-rich NTT was required to inhibit fruit and stem bromelain (>95%), whereas its removal decreased inhibition to 20% (fruit) and 80% (stem) and increased the dissociation equilibrium constant by 1.8-fold as determined by surface plasmon resonance assays. We propose that proteolytic removal of the NTT results in the decrease of the inhibitory potency of AcCYS1 against fruit bromelain during fruit ripening to increase tissue proteolysis, softening, and degradation.",151,"Alanine; Amino Acid Sequence; Ananas/enzymology; Bromelains/antagonists & inhibitors; Cystatins/chemistry; Fruit/drug effects; Glutamic Acid; Kinetics; Microsomes/drug effects; Models, Biological; Molecular Sequence Data; Plant Leaves/drug effects; Plant Roots/cytology; Protein Isoforms/chemistry; Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects; Protein Transport/drug effects; RNA, Messenger/genetics; RNA, Plant/genetics; Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology; Sequence Alignment","Cystatins; Protein Isoforms; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Plant; Recombinant Proteins; Glutamic Acid; Bromelains; fruit bromelain; Alanine",http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/151/2/515.full.pdf http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/151/2/515.full https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103043930 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2754624/ http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/plantphysiol/151/2/515.full.pdf,2,19648229,10.1104/pp.109.142232,2164539011,PMC2754624

Methods with high selectivity, wide dynamic range, and excellent precision, capable of simultaneously analyzing many biomolecules are required to decipher cellular function. This thesis describes a molecular and microfluidic toolbox designed with those criteria in mind. It also presents a tool for graphical representation of nucleic acid sequences.Proximity ligation is a novel protein detection method that requires dual and proximate binding of two oligonucleotide-tagged affinity reagents to a protein or protein complex in order to elicit a signal. The responses from such recognition reactions are the formation of specific nucleic acid reporter molecules that are subsequently amplified and quantitatively detected.A scalable microfluidic platform suitable for fluorescence detection, cell culture, and actuation is also described. The platform uses rapid injection molding to produce microstructures in thermoplastic materials. By applying a thin layer of silica to the structures, a lid made of silicone rubber coated onto a thermoplastic support can be covalently bonded to generate enclosed channels.A method is presented for precise biomolecule counting, termed “amplified single-molecule detection”. The method preserves the discrete nature of biomolecules, converting specific molecular recognition events to fluorescence-labeled micrometer-sized objects that are enumerated in microfluidic channels.I also present a novel microarray-based detection method. To attain high selectivity and a wide dynamic range, the method is based on dual recognition with enzymatic discrimination and amplification. Upon target recognition in solution, DNA probes are subjected to thousand-fold amplification in solution, followed by selective detection on arrays and another hundred-fold amplification of reporter molecule created from the first amplification reaction.Lastly, I describe a novel graphical representation of nucleic acid sequences using TrueType fonts that can be of value for visual inspection of DNA sequences and for teaching purposes",20,"Animals; Base Sequence; Chemistry, Clinical/methods; DNA/metabolism; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Oligonucleotides/metabolism; Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/analysis; Proteins/analysis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis; Sensitivity and Specificity; Thrombin/pharmacology; Time Factors",Oligonucleotides; Platelet-Derived Growth Factor; Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis; becaplermin; DNA; Thrombin,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt0502-473 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:162329 http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038%2Fnbt0502-473 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11981560 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ulf_Landegren2/publication/11387144_Protein_detection_using_proximity-dependent_DNA_ligation_assays/links/0deec538dcc00015db000000.pdf,118,11981560,10.1038/nbt0502-473,2092956762,

Until now, however, individual emulsion PCR (emPCR) reactions and subsequent sequencing runs have been unable to combine template DNA from multiple individuals, as homologous sequences cannot be subsequently assigned to their original sources.; Methodology ; We use conventional PCR with 5′-nucleotide tagged primers to generate homologous DNA amplification products from multiple specimens, followed by sequencing through the high-throughput Genome Sequence 20™ DNA Sequencing System (GS20, Roche/454 Life Sciences). Each DNA sequence is subsequently traced back to its individual source through 5′tag-analysis.; Conclusions ; We demonstrate that this new approach enables the assignment of virtually all the generated DNA sequences to the correct source once sequencing anomalies are accounted for (miss-assignment rate<0.4%). Therefore, the method enables accurate sequencing and assignment of homologous DNA sequences from multiple sources in single high-throughput GS20 run. We observe a bias in the distribution of the differently tagged primers that is dependent on the 5′ nucleotide of the tag. In particular, primers 5′ labelled with a cytosine are heavily overrepresented among the final sequences, while those 5′ labelled with a thymine are strongly underrepresented. A weaker bias also exists with regards to the distribution of the sequences as sorted by the second nucleotide of the dinucleotide tags. As the results are based on a single GS20 run, the general applicability of the approach requires confirmation. However, our experiments demonstrate that 5′primer tagging is a useful method in which the sequencing power of the GS20 can be applied to PCR-based assays of multiple homologous PCR products. The new approach will be of value to a broad range of research areas, such as those of comparative genomics, complete mitochondrial analyses, population genetics, and phylogenetics.",2,"Animals; Base Sequence; DNA Primers; DNA, Mitochondrial/genetics; Gene Amplification; High-Throughput Screening Assays/instrumentation; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Polymerase Chain Reaction/instrumentation; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Species Specificity","DNA Primers; DNA, Mitochondrial",http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/17299583 http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007PLoSO...2..197B http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0000197.t003 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1797623 http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000197 http://www.plosone.org/article/authors/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000197 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17299583 http://pure.au.dk/portal/files/508601/PLoS_ONE,77,17299583,10.1371/journal.pone.0000197,2070479548,

Meanwhile, a new generation of receptor proteins was born, which is derived from small and robust non-immunoglobulin “scaffolds” that can be equipped with prescribed binding functions using the methods of combinatorial protein design. Their ongoing development does not only provide valuable insights into the principles of molecular recognition and protein structure–function relationships but also yields novel reagents for medical use. This technology goes hand in hand with our expanding knowledge about the molecular pathologies of cancer, immunological, and infectious diseases. Currently, questions regarding the choice of suitable medically relevant targets with regard to a certain protein scaffold, the methodology for engineering high affinity, arming with effector functions, routes of administration, plasma half-life, and immunogenicity are in the focus. While many protein scaffolds have been proposed during the past years, the technology shows a trend toward consolidation with a smaller set of systems that are being applied against multiple targets and in different settings, with emphasis on the development of drug candidates for therapy or in vivo diagnostics: Adnectins, Affibodies, Anticalins, DARPins, and engineered Kunitz-type inhibitors, among others.

The RecA/Rad51 family of proteins are the key enzymes in this homology-directed repair pathway, as they perform DNA strand invasion and exchange, in concert with a host of ancillary factors. In vitro, the RecA/Rad51 family of proteins share similar enzymatic activities including catalyzing ssDNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis, formation of displacement loops (D-loops), and DNA strand exchange. After successful DNA strand invasion, DNA synthesis restores the lost genetic information using an undamaged DNA template. In this chapter, we describe two well-established biochemical assays to investigate the signature DNA strand transfer activity of RecA/Rad51 family of proteins: the D-loop assay and the DNA strand exchange reaction. Moreover, we describe a D-loop extension assay coupling D-loop formation with DNA synthesis, which can be used to define the roles of DNA polymerases in HR. Additionally, we present a protocol to investigate protein-mediated DNA annealing, a critical step in the synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) and double-Holiday junction (dHJ) pathways as well as the single-strand annealing (SSA) pathway.

It is written in Java, so executable code will run on most major desktop platforms without modification. The implementation is highly flexible, so the applet can be easily customised with additional functions; and the object classes are reusable, promoting rapid development of program extensions. Formerly, such extended functionality might have been provided via browser plug-ins, which have to be downloaded and installed on every client before loading data. Now, for the first time, an applet is available that allows interactive client-side processing of an alignment, which can then be stored or processed automatically on the server. The program is embedded in a comprehensive help file and is accessible both as a stand-alone tool on UCL's Bioinformatics Server: http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/dbbrowser/CINEMA2.02/ , and as an integral part of the PRINTS protein fingerprint database.

Coussens; Jack Sago; Shilpi Subramanian; Monika Gjoka; Dave Briner,"Genome editing is a powerful technique that can be used to elucidate gene function and the genetic basis of disease. Traditional gene editing methods such as chemical-based mutagenesis or random integration of DNA sequences confer indiscriminate genetic changes in an overall inefficient manner and require incorporation of undesirable synthetic sequences or use of aberrant culture conditions, potentially confusing biological study. By contrast, transient ZFN expression in a cell can facilitate precise, heritable gene editing in a highly efficient manner without the need for administration of chemicals or integration of synthetic transgenes.; ; Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) are enzymes which bind and cut distinct sequences of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). A functional CompoZr ZFN unit consists of two individual monomeric proteins that bind a DNA ""half-site"" of approximately 15-18 nucleotides (see Figure 1). When two ZFN monomers ""home"" to their adjacent target sites the DNA-cleavage domains dimerize and create a double-strand break (DSB) in the DNA.1 Introduction of ZFN-mediated DSBs in the genome lays a foundation for highly efficient genome editing. Imperfect repair of DSBs in a cell via the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway can result in small insertions and deletions (indels). Creation of indels within the gene coding sequence of a cell can result in frameshift and subsequent functional knockout of a gene locus at high efficiency.2 While this protocol describes the use of ZFNs to create a gene knockout, integration of transgenes may also be conducted via homology-directed repair at the ZFN cut site.; ; The CompoZr Custom ZFN Service represents a systematic, comprehensive, and well-characterized approach to targeted gene editing for the scientific community with ZFN technology. Sigma scientists work closely with investigators to 1) perform due diligence analysis including analysis of relevant gene structure, biology, and model system pursuant to the project goals, 2) apply this knowledge to develop a sound targeting strategy, 3) then design, build, and functionally validate ZFNs for activity in a relevant cell line. The investigator receives positive control genomic DNA and primers, and ready-to-use ZFN reagents supplied in both plasmid DNA and in-vitro transcribed mRNA format. These reagents may then be delivered for transient expression in the investigator’s cell line or cell type of choice. Samples are then tested for gene editing at the locus of interest by standard molecular biology techniques including PCR amplification, enzymatic digest, and electrophoresis. After positive signal for gene editing is detected in the initial population, cells are single-cell cloned and genotyped for identification of mutant clones/alleles.",,Animals; CHO Cells; Cell Nucleus/genetics; Cricetinae; DNA; Electroporation/methods; Endonucleases/chemistry; Gene Knockout Techniques; Genetic Engineering/methods; Genome; Humans; Rats; Zinc Fingers,DNA; Endonucleases,http://www.jove.com/video/3304/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3476380 https://www.jove.com/video/3304/genome-editing-with-compozr-custom-zinc-finger-nucleases-zfns https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3476380/,4,22732945,10.3791/3304,1981540403,PMC3476380

Lopez,"Abstract In all the organisms, homologous recombination (HR) is involved in fundamental processes such as genome diversification and DNA repair. Several strategies can be devised to measure homologous recombination in mammalian cells. We present here the interest of using intrachromosomal tandem repeat sequences to measure HR in mammalian cells and we discuss the differences with the ectopic plasmids recombination. The present review focuses on the molecular mechanisms of HR between tandem repeats in mammalian cells. The possibility to use two different orientations of tandem repeats (direct or inverted repeats) in parallel constitutes also an advantage. While inverted repeats measure only events arising by strand exchange (gene conversion and crossing over), direct repeats monitor strand exchange events and also non-conservative processes such as single strand annealing or replication slippage. In yeast, these processes depend on different pathways, most of them also existing in mammalian cells. These data permit to devise substrates adapted to specific questions about HR in mammalian cells. The effect of substrate structures (heterologies, insertions/deletions, GT repeats, transcription) and consequences of DNA double strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation or endonuclease (especially the rare-cutting endonuclease ISce-I) on HR are discussed. Finally, transgenic mouse models using tandem repeats are briefly presented.",433,"Animals; Chromosomes/genetics; Crossing Over, Genetic; DNA Damage; Mammals/genetics; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Models, Genetic; Recombination, Genetic; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics; Tandem Repeat Sequences",,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092187779900004X http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10343649 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092187779900004X,5,10343649,10.1016/s0921-8777(99)00004-x,1987850201,

Presently, highthroughput gene synthesis is unlikely, due to the limits of oligonucleotide synthesis. We describe a microfluidic PicoArray method for the simultaneous synthesis and purification of oligonucleotides that are designed for multiplex gene synthesis. Given the demand for highly pure oligonucleotides in gene synthesis processes, we used a model to improve key reaction steps in DNA synthesis. The oligonucleotides obtained were successfully used in ligation under thermal cycling conditions to generate DNA constructs of several hundreds of base pairs. Protein expression using the gene thus synthesized was demonstrated. We used a DNA assembly strategy, i.e. ligation followed by fusion PCR, and achieved effective assembling of up to 10 kb DNA constructs.

Restriction endonucleases (REase) that recognize DNA sequences of 4–8 bp are not sufficiently specific for this purpose. In principle, the specificity of REases can be extended by fusion to sequence recognition modules, e.g. specific DNA-binding domains or triple-helix forming oligonucleotides (TFO). We have chosen to extend the specificity of REases using TFOs, given the combinatorial flexibility this fusion offers in addressing a short, yet precisely recognized restriction site next to a defined triple-helix forming site (TFS).

Profiling protein expression and interactions: proximity ligation as a tool for personalized medicine. (Review) J Intern Med 2010; 268: 232-245. The ability to detect very low levels of expressed proteins has enormous potential for early diagnostics and intervention at curable stages of disease. An extended range of targets such as interacting or post-translationally modified proteins can further improve the potential for diagnostics and patient stratification, and for monitoring response to treatment. These are critical building blocks for personalized treatment strategies to manage disease. The past few decades have seen a remarkably improved understanding of the molecular basis of disease in general, and of tumour formation and progression in particular. This accumulated knowledge creates opportunities to develop drugs that specifically target molecules or molecular complexes critical for survival and expansion of tumour cells. However, tumours are highly variable between patients, necessitating the development of diagnostic tools to individualize treatment through parallel analysis of sets of biomarkers. The proximity ligation assay (PLA) can address many of the requirements for advanced molecular analysis. The method builds on the principle that recognition of target proteins by two, three or more antibodies can bring in proximity DNA strands attached to the antibodies. The DNA strands can then participate in ligation reactions, giving rise to molecules that are amplified for highly sensitive detection. PLA is particularly well suited for sensitive, specific and multiplexed analysis of protein expression, post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions. The analysis of this extended range of biomarkers will prove critical for the development and implementation of personalized medicine.",268,"Biomarkers/metabolism; Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics; Diagnosis, Differential; Gene Expression Profiling/methods; Humans; Neoplasm Proteins/genetics; Neoplasms/diagnosis; Precision Medicine/methods; Protein Binding; Protein Processing, Post-Translational","Biomarkers; Biomarkers, Tumor; Neoplasm Proteins",http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1365-2796.2010.02256.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2796.2010.02256.x/full http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2796.2010.02256.x/abstract http://swepub.kb.se/bib/swepub:oai:DiVA.org:uu-137718?vw=full http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:378672 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20695973,7,20695973,10.1111/j.1365-2796.2010.02256.x,2171893964,

Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) from P. furiosus is a hexamer of identical subunits and has an M(r) = 270,000 +/- 5500 at 25 degrees C. Electron micrographs showed that the subunit arrangement is similar to that of GDH from bovine liver (i.e. 3/2 symmetry in the form of a triangular antiprism). However, GDH from P. furiosus is inactive at temperatures below 40 degrees C and undergoes heat activation above 40 degrees C. Both NAD+ and NADP+ are utilized as cofactors. Apparently the inactive enzyme also binds cofactors, since the enzyme maintains the ability to bind to an affinity column (Cibacron blue F3GA) and is specifically eluted with NADP+. Conformational changes that accompany activation and thermal denaturation were detected by precision differential scanning microcalorimetry. Thermal denaturation starts at 110 degrees C and is completed at 118 degrees C. delta(cal) = 414 Kcal [mol GDH]-1. Tm = 113 degrees C. This increase in heat capacity indicates an extensive irreversible unfolding of the secondary structure as evidenced also by a sharp increase in absorbance at 280 nm and inactivation of the enzyme. The process of heat activation of GDH from 40 to 80 degrees C is accompanied by a much smaller increase in absorbance at 280 nm and a reversible increase in heat capacity with delta(cal) = 187 Kcal [mol GDH]-1 and Tm = 57 degrees C. This absorbance change as well as the moderate increase in heat capacity suggest that thermal activation leads to some exposure of hydrophobic groups to solvent water as the GDH structure is opened slightly. The increase in absorbance at 280 nm during activation is only 12% of that for denaturation. Overall, GDH appears to be well adapted to correspond with the growth response of P. furiosus to temperature.",267,"Archaea/enzymology; Chromatography, Affinity; Chromatography, Gel; Enzyme Activation; Glutamate Dehydrogenase/chemistry; Hot Temperature; Protein Denaturation; Structure-Activity Relationship; Thermodynamics",Glutamate Dehydrogenase,http://www.jbc.org/content/267/31/22681.abstract?267/31/22681 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1429615 http://www.jbc.org/content/267/31/22681.full.pdf,1,1429615,,1529551630,

The system uses either matched monoclonal antibody pairs or the more readily available single batches of affinity purified polyclonal antibodies to generate the target specific reagents by covalently linking with unique nucleic acid sequences. These paired sequences are united by DNA ligation upon simultaneous target binding forming a PCR amplicon. Multiplex proximity ligation assays thereby converts multiple target analytes into real-time PCR amplicons that are individually quantified using microfluidic high capacity qPCR in nano liter volumes. The assay shows excellent specificity, even in multiplex, by its dual recognition feature, its proximity requirement, and most importantly by using unique sequence specific reporter fragments on both antibody-based probes.

Salzberg,"Motivation: A new protocol for sequencing the messenger RNA in a cell, known as RNA-Seq, generates millions of short sequence fragments in a single run. These fragments, or ‘reads’, can be used to measure levels of gene expression and to identify novel splice variants of genes. However, current software for aligning RNA-Seq data to a genome relies on known splice junctions and cannot identify novel ones. TopHat is an efficient read-mapping algorithm designed to align reads from an RNA-Seq experiment to a reference genome without relying on known splice sites.; ; Results: We mapped the RNA-Seq reads from a recent mammalian RNA-Seq experiment and recovered more than 72% of the splice junctions reported by the annotation-based software from that study, along with nearly 20 000 previously unreported junctions. The TopHat pipeline is much faster than previous systems, mapping nearly 2.2 million reads per CPU hour, which is sufficient to process an entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day on a standard desktop computer. We describe several challenges unique to ab initio splice site discovery from RNA-Seq reads that will require further algorithm development.; ; Availability: TopHat is free, open-source software available from http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu; ; Contact: ude.dmu.sc@eloc; ; Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",25,"Algorithms; Gene Expression Profiling/methods; Models, Genetic; RNA Splicing/genetics; RNA, Messenger; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Software","RNA, Messenger",http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/19289445 http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/9/1105.short http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/bioinformatics/bioinformatics25.html#TrapnellPS09 http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btp120 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2672628 http://paperity.org/p/41792922/tophat-discovering-splice-junctions-with-rna-seq http://www.oxfordjournals.org/page/4745/5 https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/25/9/1105/203994 https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btp120 https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/tophat-discovering-splice-junctions-with-rna-seq-4 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672628/ https://www.scienceopen.com/document?vid=01882866-8513-4e09-93e6-c337d6ece027,38,19289445,10.1093/bioinformatics/btp120,2097065948,PMC2672628

Hamilton,"The ionization behavior of carboxylic acids including aliphatic chain fatty acids and bile acids in solutions, micelles, membranes and proteins is of considerable biological interest. The 13C nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift of carboxyl carbon of a variety of acids has been shown to be a linear function of the state of ionization of the carboxyl group. Thus, by measuring the chemical shift as a function of the amount of acid or base added to a solution, the state of ionization and the apparent pKa of the carboxyl group may be determined. The method is illustrated in this paper using butyric acid, and results (given as apparent pKa values) are tabulated for a variety of fatty acids and cholic acid in different environments such as monomeric solutions, micelles, membranes and bound to albumin. The apparent pKa varies greatly depending upon the environment. For instance, the apparent pKa of oleic acid is about 4.2 when bound to albumin whereas it is about 7.5 when incorporated in the bilayer of a phospholipid vesicle. Cholic acid shows similar changes in the apparent pKa, being approximately 5.2 in sodium taurocholate micelles and at least 6.8 in phospholipid vesicles. The use of 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and, in particular, I3C NMR of 13C-enriched carboxyl groups provides a method for direct observation of the state of ionization of the carboxyl group in biologically interesting acids. Such techniques may be adapted for use in biological systems, such as cells or tissues.",4,Albumins; Bile Acids and Salts; Colloids; Fatty Acids; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Ions; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Membranes; Micelles,Albumins; Bile Acids and Salts; Colloids; Fatty Acids; Ions; Micelles,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.1840040814/abstract https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hep.1840040814 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6479889,3,6479889,10.1002/hep.1840040814,2022374043,

Barbas,"Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activatorlike effector nucleases (TALENs) comprise a powerful class of tools that are redefining the boundaries of biological research. These chimeric nucleases are composed of programmable, sequence-specific DNA-binding modules linked to a nonspecific DNA cleavage domain. ZFNs and TALENs enable a broad range of genetic modifications by inducing DNA double-strand breaks that stimulate error-prone nonhomologous end joining or homology-directed repair at specific genomic locations. Here, we review achievements made possible by sitespecific nuclease technologies and discuss applications of these reagents for genetic analysis and manipulation. In addition, we highlight the therapeutic potential of ZFNs and TALENs and discuss future prospects for the field, including the emergence of clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Casbased RNA-guided DNA endonucleases. Classical and contemporary approaches for establishing gene function With the development of new and affordable methods for whole-genome sequencing, and the design and implementation of large genome annotation projects, scientists are poised to deliver upon the promises of the genomic revolution to transform basic science and personalized medicine. The resulting wealth of information presents researchers with a new primary challenge of converting this enormous amount of data into functionally and clinically relevant knowledge. Central to this problem is the need for efficient and reliable methods that enable investigators to determine how genotype influences phenotype. Targeted gene inactivation via homologous recombination is a powerful method capable of providing conclusive information for evaluating gene function [1]. However, the use of this technique has been hampered by several factors, including the low efficiency at which engineered constructs are correctly inserted into the chromosomal target site, the need for time-consuming and labor-insensitive selection/screening strategies, and the potential for adverse mutagenic effects. Targeted gene knockdown by RNAi (see Glossary) has provided researchers with a rapid, inexpensive, and high-throughput alternative to homologous recombination [2]. However, knockdown by RNAi is incomplete, varies between experiments and laboratories, has unpredictable off-target effects, and provides only temporary inhibition of gene function. These restrictions impede researchers’ ability to link directly phenotype to genotype and limit the practical application of RNAi technology.

The apparent viscosity of the fermentation broth was significantly affected by biomass concentrations in the fermenter. Fermentation broths containing 17.71 g/l biomass as dry weight were characterized by an apparent viscosity of 0.25 Pa s at a shear rate of 50 s−1. Microbial concentration also affected the power-law flow-behavior index and the consistency index. The value of the consistency index ranged from 0.002 Pa s n at a biomass concentration of 0.1 g/l to 6.14 Pa s n at a biomass concentration of 17.71 g/l.

The major class of bacterial promoters is defined by two conserved elements (the —10 and —35 elements, which are 10 and 35 nucleotides upstream of the initiation point, respectively) that are contacted by s in the holoenzyme. We show that recognition of promoters of this class depends on the “flexible flap” domain of the RNA polymerase b subunit. The flap interacts with conserved region 4 of s and triggers a conformational change that moves region 4 into the correct position for interaction with the —35 element. Because the flexible flap is evolutionarily conserved, this domain may facilitate promoter recognition by specificity factors in eukaryotes as well.",295,"Allosteric Regulation; Amino Acid Sequence; Bacterial Proteins/chemistry; DNA, Bacterial/genetics; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/chemistry; Energy Transfer; Escherichia coli/enzymology; Holoenzymes/chemistry; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Conformation; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry; Sigma Factor/chemistry; Transcription, Genetic; Two-Hybrid System Techniques","Bacterial Proteins; DNA, Bacterial; Holoenzymes; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Sigma Factor; sigma factor KatF protein, Bacteria; RNA polymerase sigma 70; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases",http://www.sciencemag.org/content/295/5556/855.short?related-urls=yesl295/5556/855 http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.1066303 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Konstantin_Severinov/publication/11535924_A_role_for_interaction_of_the_RNA_polymerase_flap_domain_with_the_sigma_subunit_in_promoter_recognition/links/00b7d522e12d086f1f000000.pdf http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002Sci...295..855K http://science.sciencemag.org/content/295/5556/855 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11823642,1,11823642,10.1126/science.1066303,1981112331,

Recently developed RNA-seq methodology has facilitated efficient data acquisition and information mining of transcriptomes in multiple tissues/cell lines. Current mammalian transcriptomic databases are either tissue-specific or species-specific, and they lack in-depth comparative features across tissues and species. Here, we present a mammalian transcriptomic database (MTD) that is focused on mammalian transcriptomes, and the current version contains data from humans, mice, rats and pigs. Regarding the core features, the MTD browses genes based on their neighboring genomic coordinates or joint KEGG pathway and provides expression information on exons, transcripts and genes by integrating them into a genome browser. We developed a novel nomenclature for each transcript that considers its genomic position and transcriptional features. The MTD allows a flexible search of genes or isoforms with user-defined transcriptional characteristics and provides both table-based descriptions and associated visualizations. To elucidate the dynamics of gene expression regulation, the MTD also enables comparative transcriptomic analysis in both intraspecies and interspecies manner. The MTD thus constitutes a valuable resource for transcriptomic and evolutionary studies.

Promoter regions from the three genes, TUB-1, ARSK1 and RPL16A were linked to the GUS reporter gene and histochemical staining was used to localize expression in potato roots in response to infection with both the potato cyst nematode, Globodera pallida and the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita. All three promoters directed GUS expression chiefly in root tissue and were strongly up-regulated in the galls induced by feeding M. incognita. Less activity was associated with the syncytial feeding cells of the cyst nematode, although the ARSK1 promoter was highly active in the syncytia of G. pallida infecting soil grown plants. Transgenic potato lines that expressed the cystatin OcIΔD86 under the control of the three promoters were evaluated for resistance against Globodera sp. in a field trial and against M. incognita in containment. Resistance to Globodera of 70 ± 4% was achieved with the best line using the ARSK1 promoter with no associated yield penalty. The highest level of partial resistance achieved against M. incognita was 67 ± 9% using the TUB-1 promoter. In both cases this was comparable to the level of resistance achieved using the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) promoter. The results establish the potential for limiting transgene expression in crop plants whilst maintaining efficacy of the nematode defence.",2,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1467-7652.2003.00037.x/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17166138,4,17166138,10.1046/j.1467-7652.2003.00037.x,2139210625,

We have set up a yeast growth-based screening system for mutant d-xylose transporters that are insensitive to the presence of d-glucose. All of the identified variants had a mutation at either a conserved asparagine residue in transmembrane helix 8 or a threonine residue in transmembrane helix 5. According to a homology model of the yeast hexose transporter Gal2 deduced from the crystal structure of the d-xylose transporter XylE from Escherichia coli, both residues are found in the same region of the protein and are positioned slightly to the extracellular side of the central sugar-binding pocket. Therefore, it is likely that alterations sterically prevent d-glucose but not d-xylose from entering the pocket. In contrast, changing amino acids that are supposed to directly interact with the C6 hydroxymethyl group of d-glucose negatively affected transport of both d-glucose and d-xylose. Determination of kinetic properties of the mutant transporters revealed that Gal2-N376F had the highest affinity for d-xylose, along with a moderate transport velocity, and had completely lost the ability to transport hexoses. These transporter versions should prove valuable for glucose–xylose cofermentation in lignocellulosic hydrolysates by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other biotechnologically relevant organisms. Moreover, our data contribute to the mechanistic understanding of sugar transport because the decisive role of the conserved asparagine residue for determining sugar specificity has not been recognized before.",111,"Biological Transport; Glucose/metabolism; Hydrolysis; Models, Molecular; Monosaccharide Transport Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Protein Engineering; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics; Xylose/metabolism",Monosaccharide Transport Proteins; Xylose; Glucose,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24706835 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3986176 http://www.pnas.org/content/111/14/5159 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24706835 http://www.pnas.org/content/111/14/5159.full.pdf,5,24706835,10.1073/pnas.1323464111,2118069954,

At a molecular level, DNA shuffling mimics, yet accelerates, evolutionary processes, and allows the breeding and improvement of individual genes and subgenomic DNA fragments. We describe here whole-genome shuffling; a process that combines the advantage of multi-parental crossing allowed by DNA shuffling with the recombination of entire genomes normally associated with conventional breeding. We show that recursive genomic recombination within a population of bacteria can efficiently generate combinatorial libraries of new strains. When applied to a population of phenotypically selected bacteria, many of these new strains show marked improvements in the selected phenotype. We demonstrate the use of this approach through the rapid improvement of tylosin production from Streptomyces fradiae.

Craig Venter,"Abstract; We have improved upon the methodology and dramatically shortened the time required for accurate assembly of 5- to 6-kb segments of DNA from synthetic oligonucleotides. As a test of this methodology, we have established conditions for the rapid (14-day) assembly of the complete infectious genome of bacteriophage φX174 (5,386 bp) from a single pool of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides. The procedure involves three key steps: (i) gel purification of pooled oligonucleotides to reduce contamination with molecules of incorrect chain length, (ii) ligation of the oligonucleotides under stringent annealing conditions (55°C) to select against annealing of molecules with incorrect sequences, and (iii) assembly of ligation products into full-length genomes by polymerase cycling assembly, a nonexponential reaction in which each terminal oligonucleotide can be extended only once to produce a full-length molecule. We observed a discrete band of full-length assemblies upon gel analysis of the polymerase cycling assembly product, without any PCR amplification. PCR amplification was then used to obtain larger amounts of pure full-length genomes for circularization and infectivity measurements. The synthetic DNA had a lower infectivity than natural DNA, indicating approximately one lethal error per 500 bp. However, fully infectious φX174 virions were recovered after electroporation into Escherichia coli. Sequence analysis of several infectious isolates verified the accuracy of these synthetic genomes. One such isolate had exactly the intended sequence. We propose to assemble larger genomes by joining separately assembled 5- to 6-kb segments; ≈60 such segments would be required for a minimal cellular genome.",100,"Bacteriophage phi X 174/genetics; Base Sequence; Computer Simulation; DNA, Viral/isolation & purification; Genes, Synthetic; Genome, Viral; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemical synthesis","DNA, Viral; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides",http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/14657399 http://www.pnas.org/content/100/26/15440.full.pdf http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003PNAS..10015440S http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC307586/ http://www.pnas.org/content/100/26/15440 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC307586/ http://fbae.org/2009/FBAE/website/images/PDF%20files/synthetic%20biology/2003%202004%20Venter-synthesizes%20phiX174.pdf http://people.csail.mit.edu/tk/6971/Smith03.pdf http://people.reed.edu/~mab/classes/phil318/venter%20PNAS%202003.pdf http://www.uniroma2.it/didattica/BiologiaApplicata/deposito/Sintetic_FX174_genome_PCR.pdf,61,14657399,10.1073/pnas.2237126100,2026916707,PMC307586

Isoform-specific functions and diseases have been reported for individual JNK isoforms mainly from gene-knockout studies in mice. There is, however, a high demand for intracellular inhibitors with high selectivity to improve the understanding of isoform-specific mechanisms and for use as therapeutic tools. The commonly used JNK inhibitors are based on small molecules or peptides that often target the conserved ATP binding site or docking sites and thus show only moderate selectivity. To target novel binding epitopes, we used designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) to generate alternative intracellular JNK inhibitors that discriminate two very similar isoforms, JNK1 and JNK2.

A promoter-less vector harboring a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-hygromycin resistance gene cassette was designed and transfected into CHO cells. Putative promoters were identified by selecting for GFP + clones under hygromycin selection. Genomic DNA from these clones was then digested and self-ligated to give rise to a plasmid carrying the putative promoter sequence as well as elements for replication in E. coli . Functional promoter sequences were subsequently identified by screening the recovered plasmids for their ability to drive GFP expression upon re-transfection into CHO cells. One of the fragments isolated through this approach was found to drive gene expression in two different reporter systems. Further dissection of the fragment led to the identification of a 156-bp element that was four-fold more active than the full-length fragment and 66% as active as the SV-40 promoter. Thus, promoter trap represents an effective strategy for identifying endogenous regulatory regions that can potentially be incorporated into expression vectors to augment expression of recombinant biopharmaceuticals.",167,"Animals; Base Sequence; CHO Cells; Cricetinae; Cricetulus; DNA, Recombinant/genetics; Escherichia coli/genetics; Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics; Molecular Sequence Data; Plasmids/genetics; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional; Sequence Analysis, DNA","DNA, Recombinant; Green Fluorescent Proteins",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165613002812 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23850860 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165613002812,1,23850860,10.1016/j.jbiotec.2013.07.001,2076213370,

On a logarithmic scale in loading rate, the force spectrum provides an easy-to-read map of the prominent energy barriers traversed along the force-driven pathway and exposes the differences in energy between barriers. In this way, the method of dynamic force spectroscopy (DFS) is being used to probe the complex relation between force—lifetime—and chemistry in single molecular bonds.

However, many transcription factors are shared between multiple genes with varying binding affinities. Beyond that, genes often exist at high copy number; in multiple, identical copies on the chromosome or on plasmids or viral vectors with copy numbers in the hundreds. Using a thermodynamic model, we characterize the interplay between transcription factor copy number and the demand for that transcription factor. Using video microscopy, we measure this effect and demonstrate the parameter-free predictive power of the thermodynamic model as a function of the copy number of the transcription factor and the number and affinities of the available specific binding sites. Understanding how to account for the effects of competing binding sites is an important facet of predictive control of transcription and gene circuit design, where transcription factors regularly navigate complex DNA binding landscapes.",156,"Escherichia coli/genetics; Gene Dosage; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Models, Genetic; Plasmids; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Thermodynamics; Transcription Factors/metabolism; Transcription, Genetic",Transcription Factors,"http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24612990 http://www.cell.com/article/S0092867414002219/abstract http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867414002219 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4080642 http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20140710-094648257 https://authors.library.caltech.edu/47132/ https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612990 https://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(14)00221-9?code=cell-site https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867414002219 http://groups.molbiosci.northwestern.edu/horvath/journClubArticles/JC_for_May%2016,%2020014.pdf http://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(14)00221-9.pdf http://www.umassmed.edu/globalassets/brewster-lab/brewster2014_si_figures.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82390724.pdf",1,24612990,10.1016/j.cell.2014.02.022,2129149800,

Based on the lessons from nature, scientists have been designing useful materials that respond to external stimuli such as temperature, pH, light, electric field, chemicals and ionic strength. These responses are manifested as dramatic changes in one of the following: shape, surface characteristics, solubility, formation of an intricate molecular self-assembly or a sol-to-gel transition. Applications of stimuli-responsive, or ‘smart', polymers in delivery of therapeutics, tissue engineering, bioseparations, sensors or actuators have been studied extensively and numerous papers and patents are evidence of rapid progress in this area. Understanding the structure–property relationship is essential for the further development and rational design of new functional smart materials.

ColE1 plasmid replication is tightly controlled by an antisense RNA mechanism that is highly dynamic, tuning plasmid metabolic burden to the physiological state of the host. Plasmid homeostasis is upset upon induction of recombinant protein expression because of non-physiological levels of expression and because of the frequently biased amino acid composition of recombinant proteins. Disregulation of plasmid replication is the main cause of collapse of plasmid-based expression systems because of a simultaneous increase in the metabolic burden (due to increased average copy number) and in the probability of generation of plasmid-free cells (due to increased copy number variation). Interference between regulatory elements of co-resident plasmids causes comparable effects on plasmid stability (plasmid incompatibility). Modulating plasmid copy number for recombinant gene expression aims at achieving a high gene dosage while preserving the stability of the expression system.

Advanced and quantitative high-throughput technologies have made the generation of enormous amounts of data on a system almost trivial. To acquire knowledge from the data, advanced genome-scale data analysis approaches have become the next bottleneck. The proper care and management of existing (prior) knowledge produced by the global scientific community is pivotal for extracting advanced biological insight from novel high-throughput data.This doctoral thesis presents the work performed to provide a foundation for systems level analysis of gastrin mediated signal transduction cascades and cellular responses (the ‘gastrin signaling system’). It describes the integration of knowledge from a great variety of sources into a network model that captures the knowledge at the time of submitting this thesis concerning the gastrin signaling system, which should impact the way future work can further the comprehensive understanding of gastrin responsive signal transduction and gene regulation networks.Transcription factors constitute an important link between the signaling cascades and ensuing gene regulatory changes. To provide precise knowledge concerning transcription factors (TFs), this thesis focuses in part on constructing a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge on TFs, both by establishing a robust set of curation guidelines for curating the transcription factors that are experimentally verified and documented in literature, and by building and making available the TFcheckpoint database: a high-quality and comprehensive information resource on transcription factors, available at www.tfcheckpoint.org. The thesis furthermore presents the first proof of concept of a complementary approach to perform gastrin systems biology developed at NTNU, namely Semantic Systems Biology.Together, the work carried out and presented in this thesis provides a solid framework for large-scale hypotheses generation to gain comprehensive mechanistic insight concerning gastrin mediated gene regulation and cellular responses.

Drugs for which a single point mutation confers a marked reduction in susceptibility are particularly vulnerable. Low clearance and a shallow concentration–effect relationship increase the chance of selection. Use of combinations of antimalarials that do not share the same resistance mechanisms will reduce the chance of selection because the chance of a resistant mutant surviving is the product of the per parasite mutation rates for the individual drugs, multiplied by the number of parasites in an infection that are exposed to the drugs. Artemisinin derivatives are particularly effective combination partners because (i) they are very active antimalarials, producing up to 10 000–fold reductions in parasite biomass per asexual cycle; (ii) they reduce malaria transmissibility; and (iii) no resistance to these drugs has been reported yet.

Homologues of PTS proteins were not identified in archaea or eukaryotes, showing that the horizontal transfer of genes encoding PTS proteins has not occurred between the three domains of life. Of the 174 bacterial genomes (136 bacterial species) analyzed, 30 diverse species have no PTS homologues, and 29 species have cytoplasmic PTS phosphoryl transfer protein homologues but lack recognizable PTS permeases. These soluble homologues presumably function in regulation. The remaining 77 species possess all PTS proteins required for the transport and phosphorylation of at least one sugar via the PTS. Up to 3.2% of the genes in a bacterium encode PTS proteins. These homologues were analyzed for family association, range of protein types, domain organization, and organismal distribution. Different strains of a single bacterial species often possess strikingly different complements of PTS proteins. Types of PTS protein domain fusions were analyzed, showing that certain types of domain fusions are common, while others are rare or prohibited. Select PTS proteins were analyzed from different phylogenetic standpoints, showing that PTS protein phylogeny often differs from organismal phylogeny. The results document the frequent gain and loss of PTS protein-encoding genes and suggest that the lateral transfer of these genes within the bacterial domain has played an important role in bacterial evolution.

In our opinion, it seems certain that biology will contribute two major capabilities for materials biofabrication — the means to generate biopolymeric components with nanoscale precision, and the mechanisms for the hierarchical assembly of nanocomponents. These capabilities will enable unprecedented control of materials structure and provide exciting opportunities at the convergence of molecular biology and macromolecular science.",11,Biocompatible Materials/chemistry; Biopolymers/chemistry; Nanotechnology/methods,Biocompatible Materials; Biopolymers,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593107000178 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17293158 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593107000178#!,1,17293158,10.1016/j.cbpa.2007.01.677,2075084977,

To obtain high level expression of the enzyme, sequences of the bacterial β-galactosidase gene starting with codon 8 were inserted in frame behind the promoter and the first seven codons of the nonessential PrV glycoprotein gX-gene. Cotransfection of this construct with viral DNA yielded PrV mutants that could be easily identified after plaque staining with a chromogenic substrate. These mutants carry the gX-βgalactosidase fusion gene inserted into the authentic gX-gene leading to loss of gX-expression. The gX-βgalactosidase fusion gene could be excised as an expression cassette and placed into other non-essential PrV genomic regions, such as the thymidine kinase gene and the glycoprotein gI-gene, resulting in inactivation of the target genes. The fusion gene remains stably integrated in the viral genome at all three locations tested.

Protein stability is an experimental metric of the information encoded in a protein sequence. This approach has allowed to engineer hyperstable immunoglobulin domains that can be expressed as intrabodies. Its application by a number of groups to a diverse set of proteins has demonstrated this procedure to be the most reliable strategy for the rational generation of stabilizing mutations. The ability to generate synthetic enzymatically active proteins from consensus sequences emphasizes the statistical nature of natural protein sequences as products of neutral drift and selective pressure. Stabilization is not the only objective for which the approach is useful, and others could include the selection of residues for nondisruptive destabilizing mutations to reduce the lifetime of proteins, or to generate proteins that can be used to screen for second-site revertants in evolutionary engineering strategies. It is found that the final steps of mutagenesis, characterization, and combination of successful residues are specific for each experimental system at hand and should be straightforward.",388,Amino Acid Sequence; Consensus Sequence; Enzyme Stability; Enzymes/chemistry; Immunoglobulin Variable Region/chemistry; Protein Engineering/methods; Proteins/chemistry; Sequence Alignment; Thermodynamics,Enzymes; Immunoglobulin Variable Region; Proteins,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0076687904880169 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15289071 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0076687904880169,7,15289071,10.1016/s0076-6879(04)88016-9,1515330096,

C. beijerinckii BA101 consistently produced on the order of 19 g of butanol per liter in 20-liter batch fermentations. This represents a greater than 100% increase in butanol concentration by the BA101 strain compared to the parent NCIMB 8052 strain. The kinetics of butanol production over time also indicate a more rapid rate of butanol production by BA101 in semidefined P2 medium containing glucose or maltodextrin. The lower levels of butyric and acetic acids produced over the course of the fermentation carried out by BA101 are consistent with an enhanced capacity for uptake and recycling of these acids. C. beijerinckii BA101 appears to more completely utilize carbohydrate compared to the 8052 strain. Carbon balance following fermentation by C. beijerinckii 8052 and BA101 indicates that sufficient carbon is available for the twofold increase in butanol concentration observed during BA101 fermentations. C. beijerinckii BA101 also has superior solvent production capacity during continuous culture fermentation in P2 medium containing 6% glucose.

With a finite number of well characterized components, protocells can be designed to maximize useful outputs. Energy conversion in cells is an intriguing output; many natural cells convert transmembrane ion gradients into electricity by membrane-protein regulated ion transport. Here, a synthetic cell system comprising two droplets separated by a lipid bilayer is described that functions as a biological battery. The factors that affect its electrogenic performance are explained and predicted by coupling equations of the electrodes, transport proteins and membrane behavior. We show that the output of such biological batteries can reach an energy density of 6.9 × 106 J · m−3, which is ∼5% of the volumetric energy density of a lead-acid battery.

A key barrier in the design of synthetic genetic circuits is that only a qualitative description of the performance and interactions of the basic genetic parts is available in databases such as the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Modeling approaches capable of harnessing this qualitative knowledge are thus timely. Here, we introduce an optimization-based framework, which makes use of the available qualitative information about basic biological parts to automatically identify the circuit elements and structures enabling a desired response to the presence/absence of input signals. Promoters and ribosome binding sites are categorized as high, medium or low efficiency and protein expressions in the circuit are described using piecewise linear differential equations. The desired function of the circuit is also mathematically described as the maximization/minimization of a constrained objective function. We employed this framework for the design of a toggle switch, a genetic decoder and a genetic half adder unit. The identified designs are consistent with previously constructed circuit configurations and in some cases point to completely new architectures. The identified non-intuitive circuit structures highlight the importance of accounting for ribosome binding site efficiencies and relative protein abundance levels in circuit design. Our results reaffirm the usefulness of the qualitative information for the coarse-grained genetic circuit design and simulation in the absence of detailed quantitative information.",237,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221714000939 http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/eor/eor237.html#ZomorrodiM14 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ejores/v237y2014i2p665-676.html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221714000939,1,,10.1016/j.ejor.2014.01.054,2121318645,

One of the major challenges for the biologist is to integrate and interpret these vast data resources to gain a greater understanding of the structure and function of the molecular processes that mediate adaptive and cell cycle driven changes in gene expression. In order to achieve this biologists require new tools and techniques to allow pathway related data to be modelled and analysed as network structures, providing valuable insights which can then be validated and investigated in the laboratory.; ; Results: We propose a new technique for constructing and analysing qualitative models of genetic regulatory networks based on the Petri net formalism. We take as our starting point the Boolean network approach of treating genes as binary switches and develop a new Petri net model which uses logic minimization to automate the construction of compact qualitative models.

PGN turnover fragments are frequently salvaged by the cells via a pathway referred to as PGN recycling. Two different routes for the recycling of the cell wall sugar <i>N</i>-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) have been recognized in bacteria. In <i>Escherichia coli</i> and related enterobacteria, as well as in most Gram-positive bacteria, MurNAc is recovered via a catabolic route requiring a MurNAc 6-phosphate etherase (MurQ in <i>E. coli</i>) enzyme. However, many Gram-negative bacteria, including <i>Pseudomonas</i> species, lack a MurQ ortholog and use an alternative, anabolic recycling route that bypasses the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of uridyldiphosphate (UDP)-MurNAc, the first committed precursor of PGN. Bacteria featuring the latter pathway become intrinsically resistant to the antibiotic fosfomycin, which targets the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of UDP-MurNAc. We report here the identification and characterization of a phosphatase enzyme, named MupP, that had been predicted to complete the anabolic recycling pathway of <i>Pseudomonas</i> species but has remained unknown so far. It belongs to the large haloacid dehalogenase family of phosphatases and specifically converts MurNAc 6-phosphate to MurNAc. A Δ<i>mupP</i> mutant of <i>Pseudomonas putida</i> was highly susceptible to fosfomycin, accumulated large amounts of MurNAc 6-phosphate, and showed lower levels of UDP-MurNAc than wild-type cells, altogether consistent with a role for MupP in the anabolic PGN recycling route and as a determinant of intrinsic resistance to fosfomycin.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Many Gram-negative bacteria, but not <i>E. coli</i>, make use of a cell wall salvage pathway that contributes to the pool of UDP-MurNAc, the first committed precursor of cell wall synthesis in bacteria. This salvage pathway is of particular interest because it confers intrinsic resistance to the antibiotic fosfomycin, which blocks <i>de novo</i> UDP-MurNAc biosynthesis. Here we identified and characterized a previously missing enzyme within the salvage pathway, the MurNAc 6-phosphate phosphatase MupP of <i>P. putida</i> MupP, together with the other enzymes of the anabolic recycling pathway, AnmK, AmgK, and MurU, yields UDP-MurNAc, renders bacteria intrinsically resistant to fosfomycin, and thus may serve as a novel drug target for antimicrobial therapy.",8,"Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology; Bacterial Proteins/genetics; Cell Wall/metabolism; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Fosfomycin/pharmacology; Gene Deletion; Muramic Acids/metabolism; Peptidoglycan/metabolism; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/genetics; Pseudomonas putida/drug effects","Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacterial Proteins; Muramic Acids; Peptidoglycan; N-acetylmuramic acid; Fosfomycin; MupP protein, Pseudomonas putida; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases",http://mbio.asm.org/content/8/2/e00092-17.abstract https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/handle/10900/81052,1,28351914,10.1128/mbio.00092-17,2603185632,

Several classes of protein scaffolds proved to yield reagents with specificities and affinities in a range that was previously considered unique to antibodies. Such engineered protein scaffolds are usually obtained by designing a random library with mutagenesis focused at a loop region or at an otherwise permissible surface area and by selection of variants against a given target via phage display or related techniques. Whereas a plethora of protein scaffolds has meanwhile been proposed, only few of them were actually demonstrated to yield specificities towards different kinds of targets and to offer practical benefits such as robustness, smaller size, and ease of expression that justify their use as a true alternative to conventional antibodies or their recombinant fragments. Currently, the most promising scaffolds with broader applicability are protein A, the lipocalins, a fibronectin domain, an ankyrin consensus repeat domain, and thioredoxin. Corresponding binding proteins are not only of interest as research reagents or for separation in biotechnology but also as potential biopharmaceuticals, especially in the areas of cancer, autoimmune and infectious diseases as well as for in vivo diagnostics. The medical prospects have boosted high commercial expectations, and many of the promising scaffolds are under development by biotech start-up companies.

Molecular analysis indicates that the decreased mRNA levels are not due to a loss in gene copies and change of integration sites. In this work, we further demonstrate that impaired trans-acting factors and spontaneous mutations to the DNA are not responsible for the reduced HC and LC transcription. Examination of two CpG sites by methyl-assisted quantitative real-time PCR assay revealed an increase in methylation of the human cytomegalovirus major immediate-early enhancer and promoter (hCMV-MIE) controlling the expression of LC and HC in cells which exhibited loss in productivity. Treatment of these cells with a DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, partially restored the lost specific mAb productivity. The increase in productivity correlated to the increase in mRNA levels of HC and LC and the demethylation of hCMV-MIE promoter.

Mitchell,"Although the acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation of Clostridium acetobutylicum is currently uneconomic, the ability of the bacterium to metabolize a wide range of carbohydrates offers the potential for revival based on the use of cheap, low-grade substrates. We have investigated the uptake and metabolism of lactose, the major sugar in industrial whey waste, by C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824. Lactose is taken up via a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) comprising both soluble and membrane-associated components, and the resulting phosphorylated derivative is hydrolyzed by a phospho-β-galactosidase. These activities are induced during growth on lactose but are absent in glucose-grown cells. Analysis of the C. acetobutylicum genome sequence identified a gene system, lacRFEG, encoding a transcriptional regulator of the DeoR family, IIA and IICB components of a lactose PTS, and phospho-β-galactosidase. During growth in medium containing both glucose and lactose, C. acetobutylicum exhibited a classical diauxic growth, and the lac operon was not expressed until glucose was exhausted from the medium. The presence upstream of lacR of a potential catabolite responsive element (cre) encompassing the transcriptional start site is indicative of the mechanism of carbon catabolite repression characteristic of low-GC gram-positive bacteria. A pathway for the uptake and metabolism of lactose by this industrially important organism is proposed.",73,"Amino Acid Sequence; Bacterial Proteins/genetics; Biological Transport; Clostridium acetobutylicum/genetics; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Genome, Bacterial; Glucose/metabolism; Glycoside Hydrolases/genetics; Lac Operon; Lactose/metabolism; Molecular Sequence Data; Phosphoenolpyruvate Sugar Phosphotransferase System/genetics; RNA, Bacterial/analysis; RNA, Messenger/analysis; Transcription Initiation Site; Transcription, Genetic","Bacterial Proteins; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Messenger; Phosphoenolpyruvate Sugar Phosphotransferase System; phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose dependent phosphotransferase system; Glycoside Hydrolases; 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase; Glucose; Lactose",http://aem.asm.org/content/73/6/1842.abstract http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1828815 http://researchrepository.napier.ac.uk/1725/ https://aem.asm.org/content/73/6/1842.full https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/publications/analysis-of-the-mechanism-and-regulation-of-lactose-transport-and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1828815/ http://aem.asm.org/content/73/6/1842.full.pdf,4,17209069,10.1128/aem.02082-06,1968564068,PMC1828815

The production of heterologous glycoproteins is at least one or two orders of magnitude lower but research is in progress to increase the production levels. In the past years the structure of protein-linked carbohydrates of a number of fungal proteins has been elucidated, showing the presence of oligo-mannosidic and high-mannose chains, sometimes with typical fungal modifications. A start has been made to engineer the glycosylation pathway in filamentous fungi to obtain strains that show a more mammalian-like type of glycosylation.

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was delivered via a membrane, and the phosphorylated biotinylated substrate was captured onto a streptavidin affinity membrane (SAM™). For detection, the SAM™ was removed, washed, and imaged on a phosphor screen overnight.

This cDNA (pGP5) encodes a 46-kDa phosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface protein with CD16 determinants and affinity for human IgG. The deduced protein sequence is most homologous to the murine receptor Fc gamma RII alpha, with slightly less homology to the human receptors Fc gamma RII and Fc epsilon RI. The cDNA hybridizes to a 2.2 kilobase mRNA in human leukocytes and a cloned human natural killer cell line. Fc gamma RIII is mapped to chromosome 1 by spot-blot analysis of sorted human chromosomes. Hybridization of Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII probes to restriction digests of human genomic DNA separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis demonstrates physical linkage of the two genes within a maximum distance of 200 kilobases.

Currently, the majority of such cloning is performed using PCR fragments.

Emerging evidence suggests that sumoylation may play a general role in regulating protein-protein interactions, as shown in RanBP2/Nup358 and RanGAP1 interaction. In this study, we have defined an amino acid sequence motif that binds SUMO. This motif, V/I-X-V/I-V/I, was identified by NMR spectroscopic characterization of interactions among SUMO-1 and peptides derived from proteins that are known to bind SUMO or sumoylated proteins. This motif binds all SUMO paralogues (SUMO-1-3). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we also show that this SUMO-binding motif in RanBP2/Nup358 is responsible for the interaction between RanBP2/Nup358 and sumoylated RanGAP1.

We first analyzed the transcriptional profiles of mouse ES cells and primordial germ cells and identified genes upregulated in pluripotent cells both in vitro and in vivo. These genes are enriched for roles in transcription, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, and DNA repair. We developed a novel computational algorithm, CompMoby, which combines analyses of sequences both aligned and non-aligned between different genomes with a probabilistic segmentation model to systematically predict short DNA motifs that regulate gene expression. CompMoby was used to identify conserved overrepresented motifs in genes upregulated in pluripotent cells. We show that the motifs are preferentially active in undifferentiated mouse ES and embryonic germ cells in a sequence-specific manner, and that they can act as enhancers in the context of an endogenous promoter. Importantly, the activity of the motifs is conserved in human ES cells. We further show that the transcription factor NF-Y specifically binds to one of the motifs, is differentially expressed during ES cell differentiation, and is required for ES cell proliferation. This study provides novel insights into the transcriptional regulatory networks of pluripotent cells. Our results suggest that this systematic approach can be broadly applied to understanding transcriptional networks in mammalian species.",3,"Animals; CCAAT-Binding Factor/genetics; Cell Line; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Computational Biology/methods; Embryonic Stem Cells/chemistry; Humans; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Multigene Family; NIH 3T3 Cells; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid",CCAAT-Binding Factor,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/17784790 http://santoslab.ucsf.edu/sites/santoslab.ucsf.edu/files/wysiwyg/MG%20MRS%20PLoS%20Gen07.pdf http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.0030145 http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.0030145 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1959362 http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030145 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17784790 http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/fetchSingleRepresentation.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0030145.sd006 http://mobydick.ucsf.edu/~haoli/plosgen_escell_07.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexandre_Gaspar-Maia/publication/6055317_Systematic_Identification_of_cis-Regulatory_Sequences_Active_in_Mouse_and_Human_Embryonic_Stem_Cells/links/09e4150e9f6f78b546000000.pdf,2,17784790,10.1371/journal.pgen.0030145,1993252465,

This review article summarizes the state-of-the-art cell printing techniques that utilize fluid jetting phenomena to deposit 2- and 3-D patterns of living eukaryotic cells. There are four distinct categories of jetbased approaches to printing cells. Laser guidance direct write (LG DW) was the first reported technique to print viable cells by forming patterns of embryonic-chick spinal-cord cells on a glass slide (1999). Shortly after this, modified laser-induced forward transfer techniques (LIFT) and modified ink jet printers were also used to print viable cells, followed by the most recent demonstration using an electrohydrodynamic jetting (EHDJ) method. The low cost of some of these printing technologies has spurred debate as to whether they could be used on a large scale to manufacture tissue and possibly even whole organs. This review summarizes the published results of these cell printers (cell viability, retained genotype and phenotype), and also includes a physical description of the various jetting processes with a discussion of the stresses and forces that may be encountered by cells during printing. We conclude the review by comparing and contrasting the different jet-based techniques, while providing a map for future experiments that could lead to significant advances in the field of tissue engineering.",1,"Animals; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Survival; Cells, Cultured; Computer Peripherals; Genotype; Humans; Ink; Lasers; Phenotype; Printing/methods; Tissue Engineering/methods",,http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/biot.200600058 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/biot.200600058/abstract http://works.bepress.com/christina_othon/11/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16895314,10,16895314,10.1002/biot.200600058,1994237305,

The plasmid is able to persist in host populations with almost chromosome-like stability with the help of a partitioning system and a copy number control system. The first part of this article describes the properties of the partitioning system comprising two plasmid coded proteins, Rep1 and Rep2, and a partitioning locus STB . Current evidence supports a model in which the Rep- STB system couples plasmid segregation to chromosome segregation by promoting the physical association of plasmid molecules with chromosomes. In the second part, the focus is on the Flp site-specific recombination system housed by the plasmid, which plays a critical role in maintaining steady state plasmid copy number. The Flp system corrects any decrease in plasmid population by promoting plasmid amplification via a recombination induced rolling circle replication mechanism. Appropriate plasmid amplification, without runaway increase in copy number, is ensured by positive and negative regulation of FLP gene expression by plasmid coded proteins and by the control of Flp level/activity through post-translational modification of Flp by the cellular sumoylation system. The Flp system has been successfully utilized to understand mechanisms of site-specific recombination and to bring about directed genetic alterations for addressing fundamental problems in biology and for accomplishing bio-engineering objectives. A particularly interesting, and perhaps less well known and underappreciated, application of Flp in revealing unique DNA topologies required to confer functional competence to DNA–protein machines is discussed.",70,"Chromosome Segregation; Chromosomes, Fungal; DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/genetics; DNA Replication; DNA, Fungal/genetics; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Genome, Fungal; Plasmids/genetics; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Recombination, Genetic; Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics; Sumoylation; Trans-Activators/genetics","DNA, Fungal; REP1 protein, S cerevisiae; REP2 protein, S cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Trans-Activators; DNA Nucleotidyltransferases; FLP recombinase",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147619X13000292 https://utexas.influuent.utsystem.edu/en/publications/the-2-micron-plasmid-of-saccharomyces-cerevisiae-a-miniaturized-s https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23541845 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147619X13000292,1,23541845,10.1016/j.plasmid.2013.03.001,2013292795,

Microscopic pockets of air trapped beneath the water droplets placed on these surfaces lead to a composite solid-liquid-air interface in thermodynamic equilibrium. Previous experimental and theoretical studies suggest that it may not be possible to form similar fully-equilibrated, composite interfaces with drops of liquids, such as alkanes or alcohols, that possess significantly lower surface tension than water (γlv = 72.1 mN/m). In this work we develop surfaces possessing re-entrant texture that can support strongly metastable composite solid-liquid-air interfaces, even with very low surface tension liquids such as pentane (γlv = 15.7 mN/m). Furthermore, we propose four design parameters that predict the measured contact angles for a liquid droplet on a textured surface, as well as the robustness of the composite interface, based on the properties of the solid surface and the contacting liquid. These design parameters allow us to produce two different families of re-entrant surfaces— randomly-deposited electrospun fiber mats and precisely fabricated microhoodoo surfaces—that can each support a robust composite interface with essentially any liquid.

Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine single lamellar vesicles of sizes ranging between 200 and 900 A in diameter have been prepared by the French press method and characterized with respect to their size distribution, stability, and thermotropic behavior by negative stain electron microscopy, molecular sieve chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. Vesicles with a diameter smaller than 400 A are unstable below their transition temperature and fuse spontaneously to form larger single lamellar vesicles. Correlation analysis of experimentally obtained size distributions and calorimetric phase transitions profiles allowed estimation of the size dependence of the transition temperature. The phase transition temperature depends on the vesicle size in a sigmoidal fashion. Throughout the entire 200-700 A diamter range, the phase transition parameters are sensitive to size; however, the size dependence is especially pronounced around 400 A in diameter. The anomalous size dependence of the transition temperature for vesicles smaller than 400 A in diameter has been attributed to a decrease in the effective bilayer curvature due to packing rearrangements of the lipid molecules. Changes in the fractional degree of self-quenching of trapped 6-carboxyfluorescein induced by osmotic stress indicate that large single lamellar vesicles are not spherical under isoosmotic conditions. These vesicles are relatively flexible and can sustain almost a 2-fold increase in their internal aqueous volume without any leakage of the internal content.",20,Drug Stability; Fluoresceins; Glucose; Kinetics; Liposomes; Molecular Conformation; Pulmonary Surfactants; Thermodynamics,Fluoresceins; Liposomes; Pulmonary Surfactants; 6-carboxyfluorescein; Glucose,http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi00515a024 https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/effect-of-surface-curvature-on-stability-thermodynamic-behavior-a-4 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6894860,6,6894860,10.1021/bi00515a024,2056615583,

Acetone and butanol levels were drastically reduced in 824(pCTFB1AS) (expresses only an asRNA against ctfB) compared to 824(pSOS95del) (plasmid control). Compared to strain 824(pCTFB1AS), 824(pAADB1) fermentations exhibited two profound differences. First, butanol levels were ca. 2.8-fold higher in 824(pAADB1) and restored back to plasmid control levels, thus supporting the hypothesis that asRNA downregulation of ctfB leads to degradation of the whole aad-ctfA-ctfB transcript. Second, ethanol titers in 824(pAADB1) were ca. 23-fold higher and the highest (ca. 200 mM) ever reported in C. acetobutylicum. Western blot analysis confirmed that CoAT was downregulated in 824(pAADB1) at nearly the same levels as in strain 824(pCTFB1AS). Butyrate depletion in 824(pAADB1) fermentations suggested that butyryl-CoA was limiting butanol production in 824(pAADB1). This was confirmed by exogenously adding butyric acid to 824(pAADB1) fermentations to increase the butanol/ethanol ratio. DNA microarray analysis showed that aad overexpression profoundly affects the large-scale transcriptional program of the cells. Several classes of genes were differentially expressed [strain 824(pAADB1) versus strain 824(pCTFB1AS)], including genes of the stress response, sporulation, and chemotaxis. The expression patterns of the CoAT genes (ctfA and ctfB) and aad were consistent with the overexpression of aad and asRNA downregulation of ctfB.",185,"Alcohol Dehydrogenase/biosynthesis; Alcohols/metabolism; Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/biosynthesis; Bioreactors; Clostridium/enzymology; Coenzyme A-Transferases/biosynthesis; Down-Regulation; Fermentation; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Protein Engineering; RNA, Antisense/metabolism; RNA, Bacterial/metabolism","Alcohols; RNA, Antisense; RNA, Bacterial; Alcohol Dehydrogenase; Aldehyde Dehydrogenase; Coenzyme A-Transferases",http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC156216 http://jb.asm.org/content/185/12/3644.full https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=634640 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC156216/ http://jb.asm.org/content/185/12/3644.full.pdf,17,12775702,10.1128/jb.185.12.3644-3653.2003,2128981014,PMC156216

Hoheisel,"Due to the success of DNA microarrays and the growing numbers of available protein expression clones, protein microarrays have become more and more popular for the high throughput screening of protein interactions. However, the widespread applicability of protein microarrays is currently hampered by the large effort associated with their production. Apart from the requirement for a protein expression library, expression and purification of the proteins themselves and the lacking stability of many proteins remain the bottleneck. Here we present an approach that allows the generation of high density protein microarrays from unbound DNA template molecules on the chip. It is based on the multiple spotting technique and comprises the deposition of a DNA template in a first spotting step and the transfer of a cell-free transcription and translation mixture on top of the same spot in a second spotting step. Using wild-type green fluorescent protein as a model protein, we demonstrated the time and template dependence of this coupled transcription and translation and showed that enough protein was produced to yield signals that were comparable to 300 g/ml spotted protein. Plasmids as well as unpurified PCR products can be used as templates, and as little as 35 fg of PCR product (22,500 molecules) were sufficient for the detectable expression of full-length wild-type green fluorescent protein in subnanoliter volumes. We showed that both aminopropyltrimethoxysilane and nickel chelate surfaces can be used for capture of the newly synthesized proteins. Surprisingly we observed that nickel chelate-coated slides were binding the newly synthesized proteins in an unspecific manner. Finally we adapted the system to the high throughput expression of libraries by designing a single primer pair for the introduction of the required T7 promoter and demonstrated the in situ expression using 384 randomly chosen clones.

The short size of the ybbR tag and its compatibility with various target proteins, the broad substrate specificity of Sfp for labeling the ybbR tag with small-molecule probes of diverse structures, and the high specificity and efficiency of the labeling reaction make Sfp-catalyzed ybbR tag labeling an attractive tool for expanding protein structural and functional diversities by posttranslational modification.",102,"Amino Acid Sequence; Bacillus subtilis; Bacterial Proteins; Molecular Probes; Oligopeptides/genetics; Peptide Library; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Proteins/chemistry; Substrate Specificity; Transferases (Other Substituted Phosphate Groups)/metabolism",Bacterial Proteins; Molecular Probes; Oligopeptides; Peptide Library; Proteins; Transferases (Other Substituted Phosphate Groups); holo-(acyl-carrier-protein) synthase,http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/4143282.pdf http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005PNAS..10215815Y http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1276090 http://www.pnas.org/content/102/44/15815.full https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=1347535 https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16236721 https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/genetically-encoded-short-peptide-tag-for-versatile-protein-label http://www.pnas.org/content/102/44/15815.full.pdf,33,16236721,10.1073/pnas.0507705102,2150881786,

Introduction of entirely new combinations of synthetic functions (e.g. novel metabolic or stress-response pathways), and retro-engineering of existing functional cell modules will drive disruptive change in cellular manufacturing performance. However, before we can apply the core concepts underpinning synthetic biology (design, build, test) to CHO cell engineering we must first develop practical and robust enabling technologies. Fundamentally, we will require the ability to precisely control the relative stoichiometry of numerous functional components we simultaneously introduce into the host cell factory. In this review we discuss how this can be achieved by design of engineered promoters that enable concerted control of recombinant gene transcription. We describe the specific mechanisms of transcriptional regulation that affect promoter function during bioproduction processes, and detail the highly-specific promoter design criteria that are required in the context of CHO cell engineering.

On average, a eukaryotic gene contains 3.7 introns per kb protein coding region. The exon distribution peaks around 30-40 residues and most introns are 40-125 nt long. The variable intron-exon structures of the 10 model organisms reveal two interesting statistical phenomena, which cast light on some previous speculations. (i) Genome size seems to be correlated with total intron length per gene. For example, invertebrate introns are smaller than those of human genes, while yeast introns are shorter than invertebrate introns. However, this correlation is weak, suggesting that other factors besides genome size may also affect intron size.

Examination of proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) free induction decays obtained from multilayer dispersions of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine provided an estimate of the methylene proton order parameter. The estimated magnitude of 0.21 is comparable to those determined for other phospholipids. Sonication of aqueous dispersions of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine led to formation of bilayer vesicles as determined by the measurement of the outer/inner choline methyl proton resonances, vesicle sizes in electron micrographs, and comparison of proton NMR linewidths between multilayer and sonicated dispersions. Ultracentrifugation studies of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles in H 2 O and 2 H 2 O media yielded a value of 1.013 ± 0.026 ml/g for the partial specific volume of this lipid. We have measured spin lattice relaxation rates for the methyl and methylenemethyne protons of the hydrocarbon chains of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine in bilayer vesicles over a range of temperatures and at two NMR frequencies (100 and 220 MHz). The observed relaxation rates for the methylene protons in this system were approximately twice those previously reported for dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine at comparable temperatures and resonance frequencies, whereas the relaxation rates measured for the methyl protons were greater than those of the straight chain lipid by an order of magnitude. Measurement of the spin lattice relaxation rates of the hydrocarbon protons of the diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine in a 10 mol% mixture of the branched-chain lipid in a deuterated host lipid, diperdeuteropalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, showed a discontinuity in the temperature dependence of the proton NMR longitudinal relaxation rates of the branched-chain lipid in the region of the gel to liquid crystalline phase transition temperature of the deuterated dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine host lipid. This result may be taken as evidence of lateral phase separation of a liquid cyrstalline phase enriched in diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine from a gel phase enriched in diperdeuteropalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine at temperatures below the phase transition temperature of deuterated host lipid. This conclusion is supported by the observation of an abrupt change in the hydrocarbon methylene linewidth (at 100 MHz) of 10 mol% diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine in diperdeuteropalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine over the temperature range where lateral phase separation is taking place according to differential thermograms.",555,"Lipid Bilayers; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Membranes, Artificial; Micelles; Microscopy, Electron; Molecular Conformation; Phosphatidylcholines/analysis; Phytanic Acid/analogs & derivatives; Temperature","Lipid Bilayers; Membranes, Artificial; Micelles; Phosphatidylcholines; Phytanic Acid",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0005273679900798 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/476096 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0005273679900798,2,476096,10.1016/0005-2736(79)90079-8,1966969615,

We engineered a novel bispecific format, referred to as mAb-Fv, that utilizes a heterodimeric Fc region to enable monovalent co-engagement of a second target antigen in a full-length context. mAb-Fv constructs co-targeting CD16 and CD3 were expressed and purified as heterodimeric species, bound selectively to their co-target antigens, and mediated potent cytotoxic activity by NK cells and T cells, respectively.

One of the two palindromic inverted repeats ofAMA1 (the 2.2-kbSalI-HindIII fragment) is sufficient to confer autonomous replication and a high transformation efficiency. Deletion of the 0.6-kb central fragment located between the inverted repeats did not affect either the ability of the plasmids to replicate autonomously or the efficiency of transformation, but did alter the mitotic stability and the plasmid copy number. Deletion of any fragment of the 2.2-kb repeat caused the loss of the ability to replicate autonomously and reduced the transformation efficiency.

However, due to the lack of steady-state kinetic information and incomplete understanding of the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway, it has been difficult to build a highly efficient, universal system. Here, we reconstituted the mevalonate pathway to produce farnesene (a precursor of new jet fuel) in vitro using purified protein components. The information from this in vitro reconstituted system guided us to rationally optimize farnesene production in E. coli by quantitatively overexpressing each component. Targeted proteomic assays and intermediate assays were used to determine the metabolic status of each mutant. Through targeted engineering, farnesene production could be increased predictably step by step, up to 1.1 g/L (∼2,000 fold) 96 h after induction at the shake-flask scale. The strategy developed to release the potential of the mevalonate pathway for terpenoid overproduction should also work in other multistep synthetic pathways. Biotechnol.

As the cost of whole gene synthesis is decreasing, whole genome synthesis at the other end of the spectrum has expanded our horizons to the prospect of fully engineered synthetic cells. However, the recently proven ability to synthesise genome-scale DNA is at odds with our ability to rationally engineer biological devices, which lags significantly behind. Most work in synthetic biology takes place on an intermediate scale with the combinatorial construction of networks and metabolic pathways from registries of modular biopart components. Implementation for rapid prototyping of engineered biological circuits requires quick and reliable DNA assembly according to specific architectures. It is apparent that DNA assembly is now a limiting technology in advancing synthetic biology. Current techniques employ standardised restriction enzyme assembly protocols such as BioBricks™, BglBricks and Golden Gate methods. Alternatively, sequence-independent overlap techniques, such as In-Fusion™, SLIC and Gibson isothermal assembly are becoming popular for larger assemblies, and in vivoDNA assembly in yeast and bacillus appears adept for chromosome fabrication. It is important to consider how the use of different technologies may impact the outcome of a construction, since the assembly technique can direct the architecture and diversity of systems that can be made.

The quality of the protein scaffold, by which the binding peptide is constrained and presented, is of crucial importance. SQT (Stefin A Quadruple Mutant—Tracy) is our most recent development in the Stefin A-derived scaffold series. Stefin A naturally uses three surfaces to interact with its targets. SQT tolerates peptide insertions at all three positions. Peptide aptamers in the SQT scaffold can be expressed in bacterial, yeast and human cells, and displayed as a fusion to truncated pIII on phage. Peptides that bind to CDK2 can show improved binding in protein microarrays when presented by the SQT scaffold. Yeast two-hybrid libraries have been screened for binders to the POZ domain of BCL-6 and to a peptide derived from PBP2’, specific to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

To determine whether proline substitution at this posi- tion in TbADH and CbADH would affect thermal sta- bility, we used site-directed mutagenesis to replace the complementary residues in both enzymes with proline. The results showed that replacing Gln100 with proline significantly enhanced the thermal sta- bility of the mesophilic ADH: DT1/2 60 min 51 88 C( tem- perature of 50% inactivation after incubation for 60 min), DT1/2 CD 51 11.58C (temperature at which 50% of the original CD signal at 218 nm is lost upon heat- ing between 308 and 988C). A His100 ? Pro substitu- tion in the thermophilic TbADH had no effect on its thermostability. An analysis of the three-dimen- sional structure of the crystallized thermostable mutant Q100P-CbADH suggested that the proline residue at position 100 stabilized the enzyme by reinforcing hydrophobic interactions and by reduc- ing the flexibility of a loop at this strategic region.

As each cell contains many mitochondria with multiple copies of mtDNA, it is possible that wild-type and mutant mtDNA can co-exist in a state called heteroplasmy. During cell division, mitochondria are randomly distributed to daughter cells. Over time, the proportion of the mutant mtDNA within the cell can vary and may drift toward predominantly mutant or wild type to achieve homoplasmy. Thus, the biological impact of a given mutation may vary, depending on the proportion of mutant mtDNAs carried by the cell. This effect contributes to the various phenotypes observed among family members carrying the same pathogenic mtDNA mutation. Most mutations occur in the coding sequences but few result in substantial amino acid changes raising questions as to their biological consequence. Studies reveal that mtDNA play a crucial role in the development of cancer but further work is required to establish the functional significance of specific mitochondrial mutations in cancer and disease progression. The origin of somatic mtDNA mutations in human cancer and their potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications in cancer are discussed. This review article provides a detailed summary of mtDNA mutations that have been reported in various types of cancer. Furthermore, this review offers some perspective as to the origin of these of mutations, their functional consequences in cancer development, and possible therapeutic implications.",25,"DNA, Mitochondrial/genetics; Humans; Neoplasms/classification","DNA, Mitochondrial",http://pubmed.cn/16892080 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16892080 https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/mitochondrial-dna-mutations-in-human-cancer-4 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aditi_Chatterjee2/publication/6895134_Mitochondrial_DNA_Mutations_in_Human_Cancer/links/5434e4f30cf294006f736f1f.pdf?origin=publication_list,3,16892080,10.1038/sj.onc.1209604,2032082852,

The core CpG island element (IE) from the hamster adenine phosphoribosyltransferase gene has been shown to prevent DNA methylation. A set of modified hCMV promoters was developed by inserting one or two copies of IE in either forward or reverse orientations either upstream of the hCMV enhancer, between the enhancer and core promoter (CP), or downstream of the CP. The modified hCMV with one copy of IE inserted between the enhancer and core promoter in reverse orientation (MR1) was most effective at enhancing expression stability without compromising expression level when compared with the wildtype (WT) hCMV. A third of 18 EGFP expressing clones generated using MR1 retained 70% of their starting expression level after 8 weeks of culture in the absence of selection pressure, while none of 18 WT hCMV generated clones had expression above 50%. MR1 also improved antibody expression stability of methotrexate (MTX) amplified CHO cell lines. Stably transfected pools generated using MR1 maintained 62% of their original monoclonal antibody titer after 8 weeks of culture in the absence of MTX, compared to only 37% for WT hCMV pools. Low levels of CpG methylation within both WT hCMV and MR1 were observed in all the analyzed cell lines and the methylation levels did not correlate to the expression stability, suggesting IE enhances expression stability by other mechanisms other than preventing methylation.

In this study, we have determined and compared the carbon fluxes of a wild-type strain (JM101), a PTS − Glc − strain, and two isogenic PTS − Glc + derivatives named PB12 and PB13 by combining genetic, biochemical, and NMR approaches. It was determined that in these strains a functional glk gene in the chromosome is required for rapid glucose consumption; furthermore, glucokinase-specific activities were higher than in the wild-type strain. 13 C labeling and NMR analysis allowed the determination of differences in vivo which include higher glycolytic fluxes of 93.1 and 89.2% compared with the 76.6% obtained for the wild-type E. coli . In PB12 and PB13 we found a flux through the malic enzymes of 4 and 10%, respectively, compared to zero in the wild-type strain. While flux through the Pck enzyme was absent in PB12 and PB13, in the wild type it was 7.7%. Finally, it was found that in the JM101 and PB12 strains both the oxidative and the nonoxidative branches of the pentose phosphate pathway contributed to ribose 5-phosphate synthesis, whereas in PB13 this pentose was synthesized almost exclusively through the oxidative branch. The determined carbon fluxes correlate with biochemical and genetic characterizations.",4,Biomedical Engineering; Carbon/metabolism; Carbon Isotopes; Escherichia coli/genetics; Glucokinase/metabolism; Glucose/metabolism; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism; Monosaccharide Transport Proteins; Mutation; Pentose Phosphate Pathway; Phosphoenolpyruvate Sugar Phosphotransferase System/metabolism,Carbon Isotopes; Membrane Transport Proteins; Monosaccharide Transport Proteins; galactose permease; Carbon; Phosphoenolpyruvate Sugar Phosphotransferase System; Glucokinase; Glucose,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096717601902095 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12009792 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096717601902095,11,12009792,10.1006/mben.2001.0209,2044318184,

The basic concept is the transformation of a quantitative problem into a qualitative problem. Individual molecules pertaining to the same molecular species (IMPSMS) are transformed to a mixture of new different molecular species (DMS) and amplified. We propose two implementations of the method. The first procedure is based on a method for cloning tagged nucleic acid molecules onto the surface of micro–beads. It should be possible to transform and determine up to 10 6 IMPSMS into new DMS. The second strategy uses multimeric linkers, a method frequently used in DNA computing to assemble random DNA.

In principle, a cell can be built from scratch by assembling small molecule sets with auto-catalytic properties. Alternatively, DNA can be isolated or directly synthesized and molded into a synthetic genome using existing genomic blueprints and molecular biology tools. Activating such a synthetic genome will yield a synthetic cell. Here we examine obstacles associated with this latter approach using a model system whereby a donor genome from H. influenzae is fragmented, and the pieces are then modified and reassembled stepwise in an E. coli host cell. There are obstacles associated with this strategy related to DNA transfer, DNA replication, cross-talk in gene regulation and compatibility of gene products between donor and host. Encouragingly, analysis of gene expression indicates widespread transcription of H. influenzae genes in E. coli, and analysis of gap locations in H. influenzae and other microbial genome assemblies reveals few genes routinely incompatible with E. coli. In conclusion, rebuilding and booting a genome remains a feasible and pragmatic approach to creating a synthetic microbial cell.

Rosson,"Abstract Glucosamine and N -acetylglucosamine are currently produced by extraction and acid hydrolysis of chitin from shellfish waste. Production could be limited by the amount of raw material available and the product potentially carries the risk of shellfish protein contamination. Escherichia coli was modified by metabolic engineering to develop a fermentation process. Over-expression of glucosamine synthase (GlmS) and inactivation of catabolic genes increased glucosamine production by 15 fold, reaching 60 mg l −1 . Since GlmS is strongly inhibited by glucosamine-6-P, GlmS variants were generated via error-prone PCR and screened. Over-expression of an improved enzyme led to a glucosamine titer of 17 g l −1 . Rapid degradation of glucosamine and inhibitory effects of glucosamine and its degradation products on host cells limited further improvement. An alternative fermentation product, N -acetylglucosamine, is stable, non-inhibitory to the host and readily hydrolyzed to glucosamine under acidic conditions. Therefore, the glucosamine pathway was extended to N -acetylglucosamine by over-expressing a heterologous glucosamine-6-P N -acetyltransferase. Using a simple and low-cost fermentation process developed for this strain, over 110 g l −1 of N -acetylglucosamine was produced.",7,"Acetylglucosamine/genetics; Cloning, Molecular/methods; Escherichia coli/genetics; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/physiology; Gene Silencing/physiology; Genetic Enhancement/methods; Glucosamine/biosynthesis; Glutamine-Fructose-6-Phosphate Transaminase (Isomerizing)/genetics; Industrial Microbiology/methods; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Pilot Projects; Protein Engineering/methods; Recombinant Proteins/metabolism",Recombinant Proteins; Glutamine-Fructose-6-Phosphate Transaminase (Isomerizing); Glucosamine; Acetylglucosamine,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096717605000200 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ming_De_Deng/publication/7854774_Metabolic_engineering_of_Escherichia_coli_for_industrial_production_of_glucosamine_and_N-acetylglucosamine/links/0a85e535fe6451d56a000000.pdf?origin=publication_detail https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15885618 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096717605000200,16,15885618,10.1016/j.ymben.2005.02.001,1995979783,

Prospective testing for allergenicity of proteins obtained from sources with no prior history of causing allergy has been difficult because of the absence of valid methods and models. Food allergens may share physicochemical properties that distinguish them from nonallergens, properties that may be used as a tool to predict the inherent allergenicity of proteins newly introduced into the food supply by genetic engineering. One candidate property is stability to digestion. We have systematically evaluated the stability of food allergens that are active via the gastrointestinal tract in a simple model of gastric digestion, emphasizing the major allergens of plant-derived foods such as legumes (peanuts and soybean). Important food allergens were stable to digestion in the gastric model (simulated gastric fluid). For example, soybean beta-conglycinin was stable for 60 min. In contrast, nonallergenic food proteins, such as spinach ribulose bis-phosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, were digested in simulated gastric fluid within 15 sec. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that food allergens must exhibit sufficient gastric stability to reach the intestinal mucosa where absorption and sensitization (development of atopy) can occur. Thus, the stability to digestion is a significant and valid parameter that distinguishes food allergens from nonallergens.",14,"Allergens/genetics; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Arachis/immunology; Biotechnology; Dietary Proteins/genetics; Digestion; Drug Stability; Food Hypersensitivity/immunology; Gastric Juice/metabolism; Humans; In Vitro Techniques; Models, Biological; Plant Proteins/genetics; Plants, Genetically Modified/genetics; Safety; Soybeans/immunology","Allergens; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Dietary Proteins; Plant Proteins",http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US9632901 http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nbt1096-1269 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9631091,33,9631091,10.1038/nbt1096-1269,1982405838,

Current methods of decoy formation have primarily been optimized for potential therapeutic applications. However, they are not ideally suited to in vitro investigations into multi-transcription factor-mediated processes that may require multiple regulatory elements to be inhibited in varying combinations. In this study we describe a novel method for chimeric decoy formation in which blocks containing discrete transcription factor binding sites are combined into circular molecules. Unlike currently available methods, block decoys allow rapid construction of chimeric decoys targeting multiple regulatory elements. Further, they enable fine-tuning of binding-site copy ratios within chimeras, allowing sophisticated control of the cellular transcriptional landscape. We show that block decoys are exonuclease-resistant and specifically inhibit expression from target binding sites. The potential of block decoys to inhibit multiple elements simultaneously was demonstrated using a chimeric decoy containing molar optimized ratios of three regulatory elements, NF-κB-RE, CRE, and E-box. The chimeric decoy inhibited expression from all three elements simultaneously at equivalent levels. The primary intended use of block decoys is in vitro gene regulation studies in which bespoke chimeras can be rapidly constructed and utilized to determine a promoter’s functional regulation.",443,"Animals; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; CHO Cells; Cricetulus; E-Box Elements; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, Reporter; NF-kappa B/metabolism; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid",NF-kappa B; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24036039 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003269713004259,2,24036039,10.1016/j.ab.2013.09.003,2021927081,

Strobel; Kanaka Shetty,"Improved atomic resolution biochemical methods are needed to identify the chemical groups within an RNA that are essential to its activity. As a step toward this goal, we report the use of 5′-O-(1-thio)inosine monophosphate (IMPαS) in a nucleotide analog interference mapping (NAIM) assay that makes it possible to simultaneously, yet individually, determine the contribution of almost every N2 exocyclic amine of G within a large RNA. Using IMPαS, we identified the exocyclic amines that are essential for 5′ or 3′ exon ligation by the Tetrahymena group I intron. We report that the amino groups of three phylogenetically conserved guanosines (G111, G112, and G303) are important for 3′ exon ligation. The amine of G22, as well as the amines of the other four guanosines within the P1 helix, are essential for ligation of the 5′ exon. Previous work has shown that point mutation of either G22 or G303 to an adenosine (A) substantially reduces activity. Like inosine, adenosine lacks an N2 amino group. Interference rescue of the G22A and G303A point mutations was detected at the site of mutation by NAIM using 5′-O-(1-thio)diaminopurine riboside monophosphate (DMPαS), an adenosine analog that has an N2 exocyclic amine. The G22A point mutant could also be rescued by incorporation of DMPαS at A24. By analogy to genetics, there are interference phenotypes comparable to loss of function, reversion, and suppression. This method can be readily extended to other nucleotide analogs for the analysis of chemical groups essential to a variety of RNA and DNA activities.",94,"Animals; Exons; Guanosine/genetics; Inosine/genetics; Introns; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Mutation; Tetrahymena/genetics; Thionucleotides",Thionucleotides; Guanosine; Inosine,http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997PNAS...94.2903S http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/30016217822 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC20295 http://www.pnas.org/content/94/7/2903.figures-only https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC20295/ http://www.pnas.org/content/94/7/2903.full.pdf,14,9096319,10.1073/pnas.94.7.2903,2084224767,PMC20295

The xylose utilization capacity of the respiratory deficiency strain was poor but improved via adaptive evolution in xylose. The μ max of the evolved strain in 20 g l−1 xylose is 0.11 ± 0.00 h−1, and the evolved strain consumed 17.83 g l−1 xylose within 72 h, with an ethanol yield of 0.43 g g−1 total consumed sugars during glucose–xylose cofermentation. Global transcriptional changes and effect of several specific genes were studied. The result revealed that the increased xylose isomerase acivity, the upregulation of enzymes involved in glycolysis and glutamate synthesis, and the downregulation of trehalose and glycogen synthesis, may have contributed to the improved xylose utilization of the strain.

This concept has stimulated development of multiplexed immunoassay platforms that provide multiple, parallel protein measurements on the same specimen.; ; Content: We provide an overview of antibody-based multiplexed immunoassay platforms and discuss technical and operational challenges. Multiplexed immunoassays use traditional immunoassay principles in which high-affinity capture ligands are immobilized in parallel arrays in either planar format or on microspheres in suspension. Development of multiplexed immunoassays requires rigorous validation of assay configuration and analytical performance to minimize assay imprecision and inaccuracy. Challenges associated with multiplex configuration include selection and immobilization of capture ligands, calibration, interference between antibodies and proteins and assay diluents, and compatibility of assay limits of quantification. We discuss potential solutions to these challenges. Criteria for assessing analytical multiplex assay performance include the range of linearity, analytical specificity, recovery, and comparison to a quality reference method. Quality control materials are not well developed for multiplexed protein immunoassays, and algorithms for interpreting multiplex quality control data are needed.; ; Summary: Technical and operational challenges have hindered implementation of multiplexed assays in clinical settings.

Harris; Ruchir P. Desai; Neil E. Welker; Eleftherios T. Papoutsakis,"Two metabolic engineering tools, namely gene inactivation and gene overexpression, were employed to examine the effects of two genetic modifications on the fermentation characteristics of Clostridium acetobutylicum. Inactivation of the butyrate kinase gene (buk) was examined using strain PJC4BK, while the combined effect of buk inactivation and overexpression of the aad gene—encoding the alcohol aldehyde dehydrogense (AAD) used in butanol formation—was examined using strain PJC4BK(pTAAD). The two strains were characterized in controlled pH ≥ 5.0 fermentations, and by a recently enhanced method of metabolic flux analysis. Strain PJC4BK was previously genetically characterized, and fermentation experiments at pH ≥ 5.5 demonstrated good, but not exceptional, solvent-production capabilities. Here, we show that this strain is a solvent superproducer in pH ≥ 5.0 fermentations producing 225 mM (16.7 g/L) of butanol, 76 mM of acetone (4.4 g/L), and 57 mM (2.6 g/L) of ethanol. Strain PJC4BK(pTAAD) produced similar amounts of butanol and acetone but 98 mM (4.5 g/L) of ethanol. Both strains overcame the 180 mM (13 g/L) butanol toxicity limit, without any selection for butanol tolerance. Work with strain PJC4BK(pTAAD) is the first reported use of dual antibiotic selection in C. acetobutylicum. One antibiotic was used for selection of strain PJC4BK while the second antibiotic selected for the pTAAD presence. Overexpression of aad from pTAAD resulted in increased ethanol production but did not increase butanol titers, thus indicating that AAD did not limit butanol production under these fermentation conditions. Metabolic flux analysis showed a decrease in butyrate formation fluxes by up to 75% and an increase in acetate formation fluxes of up to 100% during early growth. The mean specific butanol and ethanol formation fluxes increased significantly in these recombinant strains, up to 300% and 400%, respectively. Onset of solvent production occurred during the exponential-growth phase when the culture optical density was very low and when total and undissociated butyric acid levels were <1 mM. Butyrate levels were low throughout all fermentations, never exceeding 20 mM. Thus, threshold butyrate concentrations are not necessary for solvent production in these stains, suggesting the need for a new phenomenological model to explain solvent formation. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

We found that this wine yeast harbored a mutated HXT3 allele. A functional analysis of this mutated allele was performed by examining expression in an hxt1-7Δ strain. Expression of the mutated allele alone was found to be sufficient for producing an increase in fructose utilization during fermentation similar to that observed in the commercial wine yeast. This work provides the first demonstration that the pattern of fructose utilization during wine fermentation can be altered by expression of a mutated hexose transporter in a wine yeast.

Using a representative set of 80 phosphorylated substrates, we characterized the substrate specificities of 23 soluble HADs encoded in the Escherichia coli genome. We identified small molecule phosphatase activity in 21 HADs and β-phosphoglucomutase activity in one protein. The E. coli HAD phosphatases show high catalytic efficiency and affinity to a wide range of phosphorylated metabolites that are intermediates of various metabolic reactions. Rather than following the classical “one enzyme-one substrate” model, most of the E. coli HADs show remarkably broad and overlapping substrate spectra. At least 12 reactions catalyzed by HADs currently have no EC numbers assigned in Enzyme Nomenclature. Surprisingly, most HADs hydrolyzed small phosphodonors (acetyl phosphate, carbamoyl phosphate, and phosphoramidate), which also serve as substrates for autophosphorylation of the receiver domains of the two-component signal transduction systems. The physiological relevance of the phosphatase activity with the preferred substrate was validated in vivo for one of the HADs, YniC. Many of the secondary activities of HADs might have no immediate physiological function but could comprise a reservoir for evolution of novel phosphatases.",281,"Catalysis; Cloning, Molecular; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Escherichia coli/genetics; Evolution, Molecular; Genome, Bacterial; Glucose/chemistry; Hydrolysis; Kinetics; Multigene Family; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/chemistry; Phosphorylation; Signal Transduction; Substrate Specificity",Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Glucose,http://www.jbc.org/content/281/47/36149.long https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16990279,25,16990279,10.1074/jbc.m605449200,1967946076,

Datta,"The sialyltransferase family represents a group of enzymes that transfers sialic acid from its common nucleotide sugar donor, CMP-NeuAc, to the terminal carbohydrates group of various glycoproteins and glycolipids. Cloning of these enzymes from mammalian sources indicated these are all type II membrane proteins with topological features common to other glycosyltransferases. To date, 20 cloned enzymes with distinct substrate specificity have been obtained for mammalian sialyltransferases. These account for four subfamilies according to the carbohydrate linkages synthesized, namely, ST3Gal, ST6Gal, ST6GalNAc, and ST8Sia. Comparative peptide sequence analysis of these cloned enzymes showed the presence of four conserve sialylmotifs, namely 'L'- (for long), 'S'- (for short), -'III' (for being third position in sequence) and '-VS' (for very small), common to all of this protein family. Experiments by site-directed mutagenesis showed evidence that these motifs contribute to the binding of either donor or the acceptor or both. While the L-sialylmotif contributes to the binding of the donor substrate, the motifs -III and ―VS contribute to the binding of the acceptor substrate. S-sialymotif, on the other hand, contributes to the binding of both the donor and acceptor substrates. Apparently, a disulfide linkage between the L-sialylmotif and the S-sialylmotif bringing all of these motifs closer together facilitates such interaction with the substrates. In addition, although with no experimental evidence, comparative sequence analysis also suggests a strong correlation of linkage specificity of these enzymes with the peptide sequence closer to these sialylmotifs.",10,"Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Sialyltransferases/chemistry; Substrate Specificity",Sialyltransferases,http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/xref?genre=article&issn=1389-4501&volume=10&issue=6&spage=483 http://www.eurekaselect.com/69411 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19519350,1,19519350,10.2174/138945009788488422,1970909531,

To understand the mechanism of SUMO recognition by the SBM, we have solved the solution structure of SUMO-1 in complex with a peptide containing the SBM derived from the protein PIASX (KVDVIDLTIESSSDEEEDPPAKR). Surprisingly, the structure reveals that the bound orientation of the SBM can reverse depending on the sequence context. The structure also reveals a novel mechanism of recognizing target sequences by a ubiquitin-like module. Unlike ubiquitin binding motifs, which all form helices and bind to the main β-sheet of ubiquitin, the SBM forms an extended structure that binds between the α-helix and a β-strand of SUMO-1.

An RNAi-based screen performed in Drosophila S2 cells has revealed that Dicer1, Argonaute1 (Ago1) and Ago2, components involved in microRNA (miRNA) processing and function, are required for the rapid decay of mRNA containing AREs of tumor necrosis factor-α. The requirement for Dicer in the instability of ARE-containing mRNA (ARE-RNA) was confirmed in HeLa cells. We further observed that miR16, a human miRNA containing an UAAAUAUU sequence that is complementary to the ARE sequence, is required for ARE-RNA turnover. The role of miR16 in ARE-RNA decay is sequence-specific and requires the ARE binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP).

Despite the efficiency of glucose transport by PTS, the required consumption of 1 mol of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) for each mol of internalized glucose represents a drawback for some biotechnological applications where PEP is a precursor of the desired product. For this reason, there is considerable interest in the generation of strains that can transport glucose efficiently by a non-PTS mechanism. The purpose of this work was to study the effect of different gene expression levels, of galactose permease (GalP) and glucokinase (Glk), on glucose internalization and phosphorylation in a E. coli PTS− strain. The W3110 PTS−, designated VH32, showed limited growth on glucose with a specific growth rate (μ) of 0.03 h−1. A low copy plasmid family was constructed containing E. coli galP and glk genes, individually or combined, under the control of a trc-derived promoter set. This plasmid family was used to transform the VH32 strain, each plasmid having different levels of expression of galP and glk. Experiments in minimal medium with glucose showed that expression of only galP under the control of a wild-type trc promoter resulted in a μ of 0.55 h−1, corresponding to 89% of the μ measured for W3110 (0.62 h−1). In contrast, no increase in specific growth rate (μ) was observed in VH32 with a plasmid expressing only glk from the same promoter. Strains transformed with part of the plasmid family, containing both galP and glk genes, showed a μ value similar to that of W3110. Fermentor experiments with the VH32 strain harboring plasmids pv1Glk1GalP, pv4Glk5GalP, and pv5Glk5GalP showed that specific acetate productivity was twofold higher than in W3110. Introduction of plasmid pLOI1594, coding for pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase from Zymomonas mobilis, to strain VH32 carrying one of the plasmids with galP and glk caused a twofold increase in ethanol productivity over strain W3110, also containing pLOI1594. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The main focus will be on the most recent progress of the work on primarily Escherichia coli, but also on studies using a recently developed system for display on Gram-positive Staphylococcus carnosus. In addition, general strategies for combinatorial protein engineering using cell display are discussed along with the latest developments of new methodologies with comparisons to mainly phage display technology.",6,Antibodies/genetics; Bacteria/genetics; Peptide Library; Protein Engineering/methods; Recombinant Proteins/genetics,Antibodies; Peptide Library; Recombinant Proteins,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/biot.201100129/abstract http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:453629 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21786423,3,21786423,10.1002/biot.201100129,2020545473,

In addition to the loss of carbon source, the excretion of a weak acid may result in increased energetic demands and hence a decreased yield. Because glucose can enter the cell via several transport systems, isogenic strains defective in one or two of these transport systems were constructed. The effects of changes in the glucose uptake capacity on the in vivo flux distribution to a desired end product (β-galactosidase) and to acetate were studied. The lack of one of the components (IICBGlc protein) of the glucose- phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (Glc-PTS) reduced the growth rate significantly. The maintenance of a low-copy plasmid in this strain resulted in further arrest of the growth rate. However, β-galactosidase production had no effect on growth rate. This strain directed more carbon into biomass and carbon dioxide, and less into acetate. β-Galactosidase was produced in amounts not significantly different from the wild-type strain from half the amount of glucose.

However, most applications to date have relied on aberrant DNA repair to stochastically generate frameshifting indels and adoption has been limited by a lack of tools for efficient identification of targeted events. Here we report optimized tools and techniques for expanded application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in Drosophila through homology-directed repair (HDR) with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) donor templates that facilitate complex genome engineering through the precise incorporation of large DNA sequences, including screenable markers. Using these donors, we demonstrate the replacement of a gene with exogenous sequences and the generation of a conditional allele. To optimize efficiency and specificity, we generated transgenic flies that express Cas9 in the germline and directly compared HDR and off-target cleavage rates of different approaches for delivering CRISPR components. We also investigated HDR efficiency in a mutant background previously demonstrated to bias DNA repair toward HDR. Finally, we developed a web-based tool that identifies CRISPR target sites and evaluates their potential for off-target cleavage using empirically rooted rules. Overall, we have found that injection of a dsDNA donor and guide RNA-encoding plasmids into vasa-Cas9 flies yields the highest efficiency HDR and that target sites can be selected to avoid off-target mutations. Efficient and specific CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR opens the door to a broad array of complex genome modifications and greatly expands the utility of CRISPR technology for Drosophila research.",196,"Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Bacterial Proteins/genetics; CRISPR-Associated Proteins/genetics; CRISPR-Cas Systems; DEAD-box RNA Helicases/genetics; DNA/metabolism; Drosophila Proteins/genetics; Drosophila melanogaster/embryology; Endonucleases/genetics; Female; Gene Editing/methods; Germ Cells/metabolism; Male; RNA, Guide/metabolism; Recombinational DNA Repair","Bacterial Proteins; CRISPR-Associated Proteins; Drosophila Proteins; RNA, Guide; DNA; Cas9 endonuclease Streptococcus pyogenes; Endonucleases; vas protein, Drosophila; DEAD-box RNA Helicases",http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24478335 http://www.genetics.org/content/196/4/961.full.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3982687 http://www.genetics.org/content/196/4/961 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3982687/ http://www.genetics.org/content/genetics/196/4/961.full.pdf,12,24478335,10.1534/genetics.113.160713,2154395280,PMC3982687

However, while this technology has the capacity to generate hundreds of billions of nucleotides of DNA sequence in a single experiment, the error rate of ∼1% results in hundreds of millions of sequencing mistakes. These scattered errors can be tolerated in some applications but become extremely problematic when “deep sequencing” genetically heterogeneous mixtures, such as tumors or mixed microbial populations. To overcome limitations in sequencing accuracy, we have developed a method termed Duplex Sequencing. This approach greatly reduces errors by independently tagging and sequencing each of the two strands of a DNA duplex. As the two strands are complementary, true mutations are found at the same position in both strands. In contrast, PCR or sequencing errors result in mutations in only one strand and can thus be discounted as technical error. We determine that Duplex Sequencing has a theoretical background error rate of less than one artifactual mutation per billion nucleotides sequenced. In addition, we establish that detection of mutations present in only one of the two strands of duplex DNA can be used to identify sites of DNA damage. We apply the method to directly assess the frequency and pattern of random mutations in mitochondrial DNA from human cells.",109,DNA Damage/genetics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods; Humans; Metagenome/genetics; Mutation/genetics; Neoplasms/genetics; Oligonucleotides/genetics; Research Design/statistics & numerical data,Oligonucleotides,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22853953 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3437896 http://www.pnas.org/content/109/36/14508 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22853953 http://www.pnas.org/content/109/36/14508.full.pdf,77,22853953,10.1073/pnas.1208715109,2143197030,

Although high-risk E5 expression is generally thought to be lost during the progression to cervical carcinoma following integration of HPV DNA into the host genome, episomal viral DNA has been documented in a subset of HPV-16-positive malignant lesions. Numerous studies have shown that transcripts that could potentially encode 16E5 are present in cervical biopsy specimens and cervical cancer cell lines, but the presence of E5 protein has been demonstrated in only two reports that have not been corroborated. In the present study, we show that trypsin cleavage of 16E5 generates a unique four-amino-acid C-terminal peptide (FLIT) that serves as a marker for E5 expression in transfected cells and epithelial cell lines containing integrated and episomal HPV-16 DNA. Following trypsin cleavage, reversed-phase chromatography and mass spectrometry (MS) were used to detect FLIT. Immunoprecipitation assays using a newly generated anti-16E5 antibody confirmed that 16E5 was solely responsible for the FLIT signal, and deuterated FLIT peptide provided an internal standard that enabled us to quantify the number of 16E5 molecules per cell. We show that 16E5 is expressed in the Caski but not in the SiHa cervical cancer cell line, suggesting that 16E5 may contribute to the malignant phenotype of some cervical cancers, even in cells exclusively containing an integrated HPV genome.",86,"Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Cell Line, Transformed; Cell Line, Tumor; Epithelial Cells/chemistry; Female; Human papillomavirus 16/chemistry; Humans; Mass Spectrometry/methods; Mice; Molecular Sequence Data; Oncogene Proteins, Viral/analysis; Peptide Mapping; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/chemistry","Oncogene Proteins, Viral; oncogene protein E5, Human papillomavirus type 16",http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22740411 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3416135 https://jvi.asm.org/content/86/17/9465 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3416135/ http://jvi.asm.org/content/86/17/9465.full.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xuefeng_Liu4/publication/228082517_Quantitative_Measurement_of_Human_Papillomavirus_Type_16_E5_Oncoprotein_Levels_in_Epithelial_Cell_Lines_by_Mass_Spectrometry/links/00b4952632a6620c1c000000.pdf,1,22740411,10.1128/jvi.01032-12,2144246474,PMC3416135

Ideally, such oligonucleotides should be totally specific to their respective targets to avoid any cross-hybridization and should not form stable secondary structures that may interfere with the labeled probes during hybridization. We have developed OligoArray 2.0, a program that designs specific oligonucleotides at the genomic scale. It uses a thermodynamic approach to predict secondary structures and to calculate the specificity of targets on chips for a unique probe in a mixture of labeled probes. Furthermore, OligoArray 2.0 can adjust the oligonucleotide length, according to user input, to fit a narrow Tm range compatible with hybridization requirements. Combined with on chip oligonucleotide synthesis, this program makes it feasible to perform expression analysis on a genomic scale for any organism for which the genome sequence is known. This is without relying on cDNA or oligonucleotide libraries. OligoArray 2.0 was used to design 75 764 oligonucleotides representing 26 140 transcripts from Arabidopsis thaliana.

However, the development of efficient and feasible microbial processes remains challenging. Current fermentation strategies often require supplementation of expensive phenylpropanoic precursors and two separate fermentation protocols, which are significantly more difficult and expensive to undertake when migrating to large-scale fermentation processes. In this study, an Escherichia coli fermentation system, consisting of tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL), stilbene synthase (STS), malonate synthetase, and malonate carrier protein, was developed to produce resveratrol from l -tyrosine. Multivariate modular metabolic engineering, which redefined the overall pathway as a collection of distinct modules, was employed to assess and alleviate pathway bottlenecks. Using this strategy, the optimum strain was capable of producing 35.02 mg/L of resveratrol from l -tyrosine in a single medium. The strategy described here paves the way to the development of a simple and economical process for microbial production of resveratrol and other similar stilbene chemicals.",167,Acyltransferases/metabolism; Ammonia-Lyases/metabolism; Coenzyme A Ligases/metabolism; Coumaric Acids/metabolism; Escherichia coli/metabolism; Escherichia coli Proteins/chemistry; Fermentation; Metabolic Engineering/methods; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Multivariate Analysis; Propionates; Stilbenes/chemistry; Tyrosine/metabolism,Coumaric Acids; Escherichia coli Proteins; Propionates; Stilbenes; Tyrosine; Acyltransferases; stilbene synthase; Ammonia-Lyases; L-tyrosine ammonia-lyase; Coenzyme A Ligases; 4-coumarate-CoA ligase; trans-3-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propenoic acid; resveratrol,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165613003362 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23916948 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165613003362,4,23916948,10.1016/j.jbiotec.2013.07.030,1967122550,

The key recombination component is Redβ, a ring-shaped protein that facilitates annealing of complementary DNA strands. Redβ shares functional similarities with the human Rad52 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) annealing protein although their evolutionary relatedness is not well established. Alignment of Rad52 and Redβ sequences shows an overall low level of homology, with 15% identity in the N-terminal core domains as well as important similarities with the Rad52 homolog Sak from phage ul36. Key conserved residues were chosen for mutagenesis and their impact on oligomer formation, ssDNA binding and annealing was probed. Two conserved regions were identified as sites important for binding ssDNA; a surface basic cluster and an intersubunit hydrophobic patch, consistent with findings for Rad52. Surprisingly, mutation of Redβ residues in the basic cluster that in Rad52 are involved in ssDNA binding disrupted both oligomer formation and ssDNA binding. Mutations in the equivalent of the intersubunit hydrophobic patch in Rad52 did not affect Redβ oligomerization but did impair DNA binding and annealing. We also identified a single amino acid substitution which had little effect on oligomerization and DNA binding but which inhibited DNA annealing, indicating that these two functions of Redβ can be separated. Taken together, the results provide fresh insights into the structural basis for Redβ function and the important role of quaternary structure.",8,"Bacteriophage lambda/enzymology; DNA, Single-Stranded/chemistry; DNA, Viral/chemistry; Protein Structure, Quaternary; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Recombinases/chemistry; Structure-Activity Relationship; Viral Proteins/chemistry","DNA, Single-Stranded; DNA, Viral; Recombinases; Viral Proteins",http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24244379 http://dro.dur.ac.uk/13160/ http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0078869 http://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/67459/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3823998 http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0078869 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3823998/,1,24244379,10.1371/journal.pone.0078869,1967666533,PMC3823998

The superfamily also includes epoxide hydrolases, different types of phosphatases, and numerous uncharacterized proteins from eubacteria, eukaryotes, and Archaea. Nine putative proteins of the HAD superfamily with functions unknown, in addition to two known enzymes, were found in Escherichia coli alone, making it one of the largest groups of enzymes and indicating that a variety of hydrolytic enzyme activities remain to be described. Many of the proteins with known enzymatic activities in the HAD superfamily are involved in detoxification of xenobiotics or metabolic by-products. All the proteins in the superfamily contain three conserved sequence motifs. Along with the conservation of the predicted secondary structure, motifs I, II, and III include a conserved aspartic acid residue, a lysine, and a nucleophile, namely aspartic acid or serine, respectively.

In the host, only pectic lyase activity was detected, which began at the end of the biotrophic phase and increased in the necrotrophic phase of infection. Two full-length pectate lyase cDNAs, pel-1 and pel-2, were cloned from the fungus. Both genes showed similar patterns of expression when the fungus was grown in mallow cell-wall extract and pectin medium, and the only major difference in expression in culture was that only pel-2 was expressed in glucose broth.

In addition to these two alcohols, the secondary alcohol 2-propanol is produced to a concentration of about 100 mM by some strains of Clostridium beijerinckii. An alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) has been purified to homogeneity from two strains (NRRL B593 and NESTE 255) of 2-propanol-producing C. beijerinckii. When exposed to air, the purified ADH was stable, whereas the partially purified ADH was inactivated. The ADHs from the two strains had similar structural and kinetic properties. Each had a native M(r) of between 90,000 and 100,000 and a subunit M(r) of between 38,000 and 40,000. The ADHs were NADP(H) dependent, but a low level of NAD(+)-linked activity was detected. They were equally active in reducing aldehydes and 2-ketones, but a much lower oxidizing activity was obtained with primary alcohols than with secondary alcohols. The kcat/Km value for the alcohol-forming reaction appears to be a function of the size of the larger alkyl substituent on the carbonyl group. ADH activities measured in the presence of both acetone and butyraldehyde did not exceed activities measured with either substrate present alone, indicating a common active site for both substrates. There was no similarity in the N-terminal amino acid sequence between that of the ADH and those of fungi and several other bacteria. However, the N-terminal sequence had 67% identity with those of two other anaerobes, Thermoanaerobium brockii and Methanobacterium palustre. Furthermore, conserved glycine and tryptophan residues are present in ADHs of these three anaerobic bacteria and ADHs of mammals and green plants.",175,"1-Butanol; 1-Propanol/metabolism; Alcohol Dehydrogenase/chemistry; Amino Acid Sequence; Butanols/metabolism; Clostridium/enzymology; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Iron/analysis; Kinetics; Molecular Sequence Data; Molecular Weight; NADP/metabolism; Oxidation-Reduction; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Species Specificity; Substrate Specificity; Zinc/analysis",Butanols; NADP; 1-Butanol; 1-Propanol; Iron; Alcohol Dehydrogenase; Zinc,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8349550 http://jb.asm.org/lookup/resid/175/16/5097?view=full&uritype=cgi http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC204976 http://jb.asm.org/content/175/16/5097.abstract?cited-by=yesl175/16/5097 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8349550 http://jb.asm.org/content/175/16/5097.full.pdf,40,8349550,10.1128/jb.175.16.5097-5105.1993,1529159985,

Aleksenko; A.J. Clutterbuck,"Abstract With few exceptions, in eukaryotic organisms the presence of a chromosomal replicator on a circular vector molecule is not sufficient to confer on it the ability to persist and replicate extrachromosomally. However, it is possible to isolate from genomes of some filamentous fungi DNA fragments which can provide extrachromosomal maintenance of plasmids. In Aspergillus nidulans, two functional classes of such sequences can be distinguished: effective plasmid replicators (e.g., AMA1) and transformation enhancers (e.g., ANS1 or MATEs), which apparently are able to initiate aberrant replication, leading to vector rearrangement and multimerization and eventually resulting in chromosomal integration. We discuss the similarity of these events to DNA amplification in other eukaryotes. A model is suggested which accounts for the formation of effective replicating plasmids as a result of sequence amplification. The model is based on the observation that in some organisms, including A. nidulans and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, duplication of an inefficient replicator enhances its efficiency dramatically. Some structural traits of transformation enhancers in A. nidulans imply a role for topoisomerases in amplification and replication of circular DNA molecules. We discuss practical applications of replicative vectors for gene cloning and expression studies.",21,"Amino Acid Sequence; Aspergillus nidulans/genetics; Base Sequence; Cloning, Molecular/methods; DNA Replication; DNA, Fungal/biosynthesis; Gene Amplification; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Data; Plasmids; Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Restriction Mapping; Schizosaccharomyces/genetics","DNA, Fungal",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087184597909804 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9290250 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087184597909804,42,9290250,10.1006/fgbi.1997.0980,2142240162,

The dependence of membrane specific capacitance on the chain-length of the alkane oil present in the bilayer is similar to that observed in black lipid membranes. In contrast to conventional artificial bilayers, DIBs are not confined by an aperture, which enables us to determine that the dependence of whole bilayer capacitance on applied potential is predominantly a result of a spontaneous increase in bilayer area. This area change arises from the creation of new bilayer at the three phase interface and is driven by changes in surface tension with applied potential that can be described by the Young-Lippmann equation. By accounting for this area change, we are able to determine the proportion of the capacitance dependence that arises from a change in specific capacitance with applied potential.

Comstock; Mark Vasser,"Abstract; Two hybrid promoters that are functional in Escherichia coli have been constructed. These hybrid promoters, tacI and tacII, were derived from sequences of the trp and the lac UV5 promoters. In the first hybrid promoter (tacI), the DNA upstream of position -20 with respect to the transcriptional start site was derived from the trp promoter. The DNA downstream of position -20 was derived from the lac UV5 promoter. In the second hybrid promoter (tacII), the DNA upstream of position -11 at the Hpa I site within the Pribnow box was derived from the trp promoter. The DNA downstream of position -11 is a 46-base-pair synthetic DNA fragment that specifies part of the hybrid Pribnow box and the entire lac operator. It also specifies a Shine-Dalgarno sequence flanked by two unique restriction sites (portable Shine-Dalgarno sequence). The tacI and the tacII promoters respectively direct transcription approximately 11 and 7 times more efficiently than the derepressed parental lac UV5 promoter and approximately 3 and 2 times more efficiently than the trp promoter in the absence of the trp repressor. Both hybrid promoters can be repressed by the lac repressor and both can be derepressed with isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside. Consequently, these hybrid promoters are useful for the controlled expression of foreign genes at high levels in E. coli. In contrast to the trp and the lac UV5 promoters, the tacI promoter has not only a consensus -35 sequence but also a consensus Pribnow box sequence. This may explain the higher efficiency of this hybrid promoter with respect to either one of the parental promoters.",80,"Base Sequence; Escherichia coli/genetics; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Engineering; Lac Operon; Operon; Plasmids; Structure-Activity Relationship; Transcription, Genetic; Tryptophan/genetics",Tryptophan,http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/13312.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC393301/ http://www.pnas.org/content/80/1/21 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC393301/ http://www.pnas.org/content/80/1/21.full.pdf,1161,6337371,10.1073/pnas.80.1.21,2161273461,PMC393301

Brandon; Pierre Baldi; Douglas C. Wallace,"The metabolism of solid tumors is associated with high lactate production while growing in oxygen (aerobic glycolysis) suggesting that tumors may have defects in mitochondrial function. The mitochondria produce cellular energy by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a by-product, and regulate apoptosis via the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mtPTP). The mitochondria are assembled from both nuclear DNA (nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes. The mtDNA codes for 37 genes essential of OXPHOS, is present in thousands of copies per cell, and has a very high mutations rate. In humans, severe mtDNA mutations result in multisystem disease, while some functional population-specific polymorphisms appear to have permitted humans to adapt to new environments. Mutations in the nDNA-encoded mitochondrial genes for fumarate hydratase and succinate dehydrogenase have been linked to uterine leiomyomas and paragangliomas, and cancer cells have been shown to induce hexokinase II which harnesses OXPHOS adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production to drive glycolysis. Germline mtDNA mutations at nucleotides 10398 and 16189 have been associated with breast cancer and endometrial cancer. Tumor mtDNA somatic mutations range from severe insertion–deletion and chain termination mutations to mild missense mutations. Surprisingly, of the 190 tumor-specific somatic mtDNA mutations reported, 72% are also mtDNA sequence variants found in the general population. These include 52% of the tumor somatic mRNA missense mutations, 83% of the tRNA mutations, 38% of the rRNA mutations, and 85% of the control region mutations. Some associations might reflect mtDNA sequencing errors, but analysis of several of the tumor-specific somatic missense mutations with population counterparts appear legitimate. Therefore, mtDNA mutations in tumors may fall into two main classes: (1) severe mutations that inhibit OXPHOS, increase ROS production and promote tumor cell proliferation and (2) milder mutations that may permit tumors to adapt to new environments. The former may be lost during subsequent tumor oxygenation while the latter may become fixed. Hence, mitochondrial dysfunction does appear to be a factor in cancer etiology, an insight that may suggest new approaches for diagnosis and treatment.",25,Cell Nucleus/genetics; Humans; Mitochondria/genetics; Mutation; Neoplasms/genetics,,http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=18051611 http://www.nature.com/onc/journal/v25/n34/full/1209607a.html?message=remove https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16892079 http://www.igb.uci.edu/~pfbaldi/publications/journals/2006/1209607a.pdf,5,16892079,10.1038/sj.onc.1209607,2008523969,

We functionally characterized five notochord enhancers, whose sequence is highly conserved, and systematically mutated two of them. Two subregions were identified to be essential for expression in the notochord of the zebrafish embryo. Synthetic enhancers containing the two essential regions in front of a TATA-box drive expression in the notochord while concatemerization of the subregions alone is not sufficient, indicating that the combination of the two sequence elements is required for notochord expression. Both regions are present in the five functionally characterized notochord enhancers. However, the position, the distance and relative orientation of the two sequence motifs can vary substantially within the enhancer sequences. This suggests that the regulatory grammar itself does not dictate the high evolutionary conservation between these orthologous cis-regulatory sequences.

Strain-to-strain variations, in response to growth substrate, were observed at different levels, such as cultural behavior, amount of enzyme secreted, or enzyme composition. All strains grew well on glucose and cellobiose. The majority of strains, however, did not thrive on lactose, which was also inefficient in triggering the secretion of cellulase enzymes. A cellulase system was typically formed during growth on cellulose (Avicel), but some systems were also induced, although less efficiently, by cellobiose. The composition of the cellulase system produced by different strains was analyzed by anion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and chromatofocusing and found to be strikingly similar, though not identical. The exocellulase component of the systems was assayed directly in the crude culture filtrate by a procedure involving the hydrolysis of p -nitrophenyllactoside and by an electroimmunoassay performed with a specific rabbit antiserum raised against the pure component from strain ATCC 42 464, as reference strain. Enzyme from all strains of Myceliophthora thermophila cross-reacted with the antiserum in a manner that exactly paralleled the enzymatic detection of exocellulase: these observations showed that the different exocomponents had similar antigenic determinants.",14,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/014102299290156I https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/014102299290156I#!,10,,10.1016/0141-0229(92)90156-i,1984457594,

The first protein therapeutics were recombinant versions of natural proteins. Proteins purposefully modified to increase their clinical potential soon followed with enhancements derived from protein or glycoengineering, Fc fusion or conjugation to polyethylene glycol. Antibody-based drugs subsequently arose as the largest and fastest growing class of protein therapeutics. The rationale for developing better protein therapeutics with enhanced efficacy, greater safety, reduced immunogenicity or improved delivery comes from the convergence of clinical, scientific, technological and commercial drivers that have identified unmet needs and provided strategies to address them. Future protein drugs seem likely to be more extensively engineered to improve their performance, e.g., antibodies and Fc fusion proteins with enhanced effector functions or extended half-life. Two old concepts for improving antibodies, namely antibody-drug conjugates and bispecific antibodies, have advanced to the cusp of clinical success. As for newer protein therapeutic platform technologies, several engineered protein scaffolds are in early clinical development and offer differences and some potential advantages over antibodies.",317,Animals; Antibodies/therapeutic use; Drug Design; Humans; Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry; Protein Engineering/methods; Proteins/chemistry,Antibodies; Proteins; Polyethylene Glycols,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014482711000644 https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21371474 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014482711000644,43,21371474,10.1016/j.yexcr.2011.02.013,2025629542,

The microarray was constructed using a collection of genes which are orthologs of members of gene families previously found to be important to the physiology of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824. Similar to the onset of solventogenesis in C. acetobutylicum 824, the onset of solventogenesis in C. beijerinckii 8052 was concurrent with the initiation of sporulation.

EDTA serves as an ""artificial"" PA in that it exhibited similar rate constants for Mg2+ (3 s-1) and Ca2+ (0.7 s-1) dissociation at 10 degrees C. When introduced into frog skeletal muscle, EDTA increased the relaxation rate by approximately 2.7-fold, and with increasing tetanus duration, EDTA lost its ability to contribute to relaxation (and Ca2+ sequestration) at its Mg2+ off-rate. Intracellular EDTA recovered its ability to contribute to muscle relaxation and Ca2+ sequestration at its Ca2+ off-rate. Like PA, EDTA's contribution to muscle relaxation and Ca2+ sequestration was more clearly observed when the SR Ca-ATPase was inhibited. Introduction of EDTA into rat soleus muscle, which has low [PA], increased the relaxation rate in a manner that was analogous to the way in which PA facilitates relaxation of frog skeletal muscle. Thus intracellular EDTA serves as an effective mimic of PA, and its use should aid in our understanding of PA's function in muscle and nerve.",76,"Animals; Biophysical Phenomena; Biophysics; Calcium/metabolism; Calcium-Transporting ATPases/antagonists & inhibitors; Chelating Agents/metabolism; Edetic Acid/metabolism; In Vitro Techniques; Intracellular Fluid/metabolism; Kinetics; Magnesium/metabolism; Male; Muscle Fibers, Slow-Twitch/drug effects; Muscle Relaxation/drug effects; Muscle, Skeletal/drug effects; Parvalbumins/metabolism; Rana temporaria; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Troponin C/metabolism",Chelating Agents; Parvalbumins; Troponin C; Edetic Acid; Calcium-Transporting ATPases; Magnesium; Calcium,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/10049331 http://www.cell.com/biophysj/references/S0006-3495(99)77310-8 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349599773108 http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999BpJ....76.1514J http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1300127 http://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(99)77310-8?scriptOff=true https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1300127/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349599773108 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82714975.pdf,2,10049331,10.1016/s0006-3495(99)77310-8,1986899396,PMC1300127

This study has used a rat serum model to define some of the characteristics of liposomes which modulate their ability to activate complement. Using functional hemolytic assays and C3/C3b crossed immunoelectrophoresis, we have demonstrated that liposomes activated rat complement in a dose-dependent manner with higher concentrations of liposomes activating higher levels of complement. The detection of complement activation required the inclusion of phospholipids bearing a net charge. Complement activation occurred via the classical pathway; no alternative pathway activation was detected. The presence of cholesterol contributed to complement activation in a dose-dependent manner. Phospholipid fatty acyl chain length did not influence complement activation while the introduction of unsaturated acyl chains markedly decreased levels of complement activation. Liposome size also influenced complement activation with 400 nm unilamellar vesicles more effectively activating complement than 50 nm vesicles for equivalent amounts of exposed lipid. These studies demonstrate that the composition of the liposome greatly affects the in vitro activation of rat serum complement and suggest that the biological half-life of liposomes in the circulation of rats may be altered by changing the liposome composition to reduce complement activation.",1191,"Animals; Blood; Complement Pathway, Classical; Complement System Proteins/metabolism; Humans; Immunoelectrophoresis, Two-Dimensional; Liposomes/metabolism; Rats",Liposomes; Complement System Proteins,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8155683 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0005273694902313,3,8155683,10.1016/0005-2736(94)90231-3,2005367319,

Combining modeling and experiments, we classify promoters according to their signal-processing behavior and reveal that multiple, distinct gene expression programs can be encoded in the dynamics of Msn2. We show that both oscillatory TF dynamics and slow promoter kinetics lead to higher noise in gene expression. Furthermore, we show that the promoter activation timescale is related to nucleosome remodeling.

Koffas; Gregory Stephanopoulos,"Abstract The development of efficient microbial processes for the production of flavonoids has been a metabolic engineering goal for the past several years, primarily due to the purported health-promoting effects of these compounds. Although significant strides have been made recently in improving strain titers and yields, current fermentation strategies suffer from two major drawbacks—(1) the requirement for expensive phenylpropanoic precursors supplemented into the media and (2) the need for two separate media formulations for biomass/protein generation and flavonoid production. In this study, we detail the construction of a series of strains capable of bypassing both of these problems. A four-step heterologous pathway consisting of the enzymes tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS), and chalcone isomerase (CHI) was assembled within two engineered l -tyrosine Escherichia coli overproducers in order to enable the production of the main flavonoid precursor naringenin directly from glucose. During the course of this investigation, we discovered that extensive optimization of both enzyme sources and relative gene expression levels was required to achieve high quantities of both p -coumaric acid and naringenin accumulation. Once this metabolic balance was achieved, however, such strains were found to be capable of producing 29 mg/l naringenin from glucose and up to 84 mg/l naringenin with the addition of the fatty acid enzyme inhibitor, cerulenin. These results were obtained through cultivation of E. coli in a single minimal medium formulation without additional precursor supplementation, thus paving the way for the development of a simple and economical process for the microbial production of flavonoids directly from glucose.",13,"Escherichia coli K12/enzymology; Flavanones/biosynthesis; Gene Expression; Glucose/metabolism; Organisms, Genetically Modified/genetics; Plant Proteins/biosynthesis; Pueraria/enzymology; Sweetening Agents/metabolism",Flavanones; Plant Proteins; Sweetening Agents; naringenin; Glucose,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096717611000140 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21320631 https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-69fa2f78-695d-391f-ab0b-d4481f20f15f https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096717611000140 http://homepages.rpi.edu/~koffam/papers/2011_Santos_Koffas_Stephanopoulos.pdf,12,21320631,10.1016/j.ymben.2011.02.002,2050461585,

Downregulation of primary metabolic enzymes possibly combined with overexpression of other metabolic enzymes may result in profound changes in product formation, and this may alter the large-scale transcriptional program of the cells. DNA-array based large-scale transcriptional analysis has the potential to elucidate factors that control cellular fluxes even in the absence of proteome data. These themes are explored in the study of large-scale transcriptional analysis programs and the in vivo primary-metabolism fluxes of several related recombinant C. acetobutylicum strains: C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824(pSOS95del) (plasmid control; produces high levels of butanol snd acetone), 824(pCTFB1AS) (expresses antisense RNA against CoA transferase (ctfb1-asRNA); produces very low levels of butanol and acetone), and 824(pAADB1) (expresses ctfb1-asRNA and the alcohol-aldehyde dahydrogenase gene (aad); produce high alcohol and low acetone levels). DNA-array based transcriptional analysis revealed that the large changes in product concentrations (snd notably butanol concentration) due to ctfb1-asRNA expression alone and in combination with aad overexpression resulted in dramatic changes of the cellular transcriptome. Cluster analysis and gene expression patterns of established and putative operons involved in stress response, motility, sporulation, and fatty-acid biosynthesis indicate that these simple genetic changes dramatically alter the cellular programs of C. acetobutylicum. Comparison of gene expression and flux analysis data may point to possible flux-controling steps and suggest unknown regulatory mechanisms. © 2003; Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",84,"Adaptation, Physiological/physiology; Clostridium/growth & development; Computer Simulation; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial/physiology; Models, Biological; Multienzyme Complexes/metabolism; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods; Recombinant Proteins/metabolism; Species Specificity; Transcription, Genetic/physiology",Multienzyme Complexes; Recombinant Proteins,http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/bit.10851 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.10851/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14708125,7,14708125,10.1002/bit.10851,2023373684,

With the advent of massively parallel sequencing technologies, DNA sequencing costs have been dramatically reduced. No longer is it unthinkable to sequence hundreds or even thousands of genes in a single individual with a suspected genetic disease or complex disease predisposition. Along with the benefits offered by these technologies come a number of challenges that must be addressed before wide-scale sequencing becomes accepted medical practice. Molecular diagnosticians will need to become comfortable with, and gain confidence in, these new platforms, which are based on radically different technologies compared to the standard DNA sequencers in routine use today. Experience will determine whether these instruments are best applied to sequencing versus resequencing. Perhaps most importantly, along with increasing read lengths inevitably comes increased ascertainment of novel sequence variants of uncertain clinical significance, the postanalytical aspects of which could bog down the entire field. But despite these obstacles, and as a direct result of the promises these sequencing advances present, it will likely not be long before next-generation sequencing begins to make an impact in molecular medicine.

To further enhance the efficiency of PET analysis and at the same time overcome the drawbacks of the new sequencing method, we coupled multiplex sequencing with paired-end ditagging (MS-PET) using modified PET procedures to simultaneously sequence 200 000 to 300 000 dimerized PET (diPET) templates, with an output of nearly half-a-million PET sequences in a single 4 h machine run. We demonstrate the utility and robustness of MS-PET by analyzing the transcriptome of human breast carcinoma cells, and by mapping p53 binding sites in the genome of human colorectal carcinoma cells.

A library built up from genomic fragments of the virulent S. aureus COL strain (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) allowed us to screen all possible encoded peptides for immunoreactivity. As selective agents, human sera exhibiting a high antibody titer and opsonic activity against S. aureus were used, since these antibodies indicate the in vivo expression and immunoreactivity of the corresponding proteins. Identified clones cluster in distinct regions of 75 genes, most of them classifiable as secreted or surface-localized proteins, including previously identified virulence factors. In addition, 14 putative novel short open reading frames were identified and their immunoreactivity and in vivo mRNA expression were confirmed, underscoring the annotation-independent, true genomic nature of our approach. Evidence is provided that a large fraction of the identified peptides cannot be expressed in an in vivo-based surface display system. Thus, in vitro protein selection, not biased by the context of living entities, allows screening of genomic expression libraries with a large number of different ligands simultaneously.

Voigt,"Synthetic genetic sensors and circuits enable programmable control over the timing and conditions of gene expression. They are being increasingly incorporated into the control of complex, multigene pathways and cellular functions. Here, we propose a design strategy to genetically separate the sensing/circuitry functions from the pathway to be controlled. This separation is achieved by having the output of the circuit drive the expression of a polymerase, which then activates the pathway from polymerase-specific promoters. The sensors, circuits and polymerase are encoded together on a ‘controller’ plasmid. Variants of T7 RNA polymerase that reduce toxicity were constructed and used as scaffolds for the construction of four orthogonal polymerases identified via part mining that bind to unique promoter sequences. This set is highly orthogonal and induces cognate promoters by 8- to 75-fold more than off-target promoters. These orthogonal polymerases enable four independent channels linking the outputs of circuits to the control of different cellular functions. As a demonstration, we constructed a controller plasmid that integrates two inducible systems, implements an AND logic operation and toggles between metabolic pathways that change Escherichia coli green (deoxychromoviridans) and red (lycopene). The advantages of this organization are that (i) the regulation of the pathway can be changed simply by introducing a different controller plasmid, (ii) transcription is orthogonal to host machinery and (iii) the pathway genes are not transcribed in the absence of a controller and are thus more easily carried without invoking evolutionary pressure.",40,"DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/genetics; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genetic Engineering; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Viral Proteins/genetics",Viral Proteins; bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases,http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/72487/1/Temme-2012-Modular%20control%20of%20m.pdf http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/72487 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3458549 http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/06/28/nar.gks597.long https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/40/17/8773/2411560 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3458549/ http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/72487/Temme-2012-Modular%20control%20of%20m.pdf?sequence=1,3,22743271,10.1093/nar/gks597,2160219474,PMC3458549

The enzyme activity was separated into two major and several faint minor peaks by hydrophobic chromatography. These peaks were conventionally designated as CP1, CP2 and CP3, according to their order of elution. From the analyses of molecular mass, subunit structure, amino acid sequences and cDNA cloning, CP2 was a monomer complex (SoCP-CPI) (51 kDa) composed of a 41-kDa core protein, SoCP (Spinacia oleracea cysteine protease), and 14-kDa cystatin, a cysteine protease inhibitor (CPI), while CP3 was a trimer complex (SoCP-CPI) 3 (151 kDa) of the same subunits as SoCP-CPI and showed a wider range of specificity toward natural substrates than SoCP-CPI. Trimer (SoCP-CPI) 3 was irreversibly formed from monomers through association. The results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that mRNAs of CPI and SoCP are hardly expressed in green leaves, but they are coordinately expressed in senescent leaves, suggesting that these proteases involve in senescence. Purified recombinant CPI had strong inhibitory activity against trimer SoCP, (SoCP) 3 , which had a cystatin deleted with K i value of 1.33 x 10- 9 M. After treatment of the enzyme with a succinate buffer (pH 5) at the most active pH of the enzyme, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and activity analyses showed that cystatin was released from both monomer SoCP-CPI and trimer (SoCP-CPI) 3 complexes with a concomitant activation.

These switches provide unprecedented precision, complexity and reliability when programming novel mammalian cell functions. Metabolite-responsive repressors of human-pathogenic bacteria are particularly attractive for use in these orthogonal synthetic mammalian gene switches because the trigger compound sensitivity often matches the human physiological range. We have designed both a bile acid-repressible (BEAR OFF ) as well as a bile-acid-inducible (BEAR ON ) gene switch by capitalizing on components that have evolved to manage bile acid resistance in Campylobacter jejuni , the leading causative agent of human food-borne enteritis. We have shown that both of these switches enable bile acid-adjustable transgene expression in different mammalian cell lines as well as in mice. For the BEAR OFF device, the C. jejuni repressor CmeR was fused to the VP16 transactivation domain to create a synthetic transactivator that activates minimal promoters containing tandem operator modules (O cme ) in a bile acid-repressible manner. Fusion of CmeR to a transsilencing domain resulted in an artificial transsilencer that binds and represses a constitutive O cme -containing promoter until it is released by addition of bile acid (BEAR ON ). A tailored multi-step tuning program for the inducible gene switch, which included the optimization of individual component performance, control of their relative abundances, the choice of the cell line and trigger compound, resulted in a BEAR ON device with significantly improved bile acid-responsive control characteristics. Synthetic metabolite-triggered gene switches that are able to interface with host metabolism may foster advances in future gene and cell-based therapies.",21,Animals; Bacterial Proteins/biosynthesis; Bile Acids and Salts/pharmacology; CHO Cells; COS Cells; Campylobacter jejuni/genetics; Cercopithecus aethiops; Cricetinae; Cricetulus; Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects; HEK293 Cells; HeLa Cells; Herpes Simplex Virus Protein Vmw65/biosynthesis; Humans; Mice; Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics; Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis; Transgenes,Bacterial Proteins; Bile Acids and Salts; Herpes Simplex Virus Protein Vmw65; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Repressor Proteins,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096717613001079 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24280297 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096717613001079,2,24280297,10.1016/j.ymben.2013.11.003,2019433804,

To further such studies, it is important to find conditions under which the dwell time of cyclodextrins in the lumen of the pore is extended. Here, we use single-channel recording to explore the pH- and voltage-dependence of the interaction of beta-cyclodextrin (betaCD) with alphaHL. betaCD can access its binding site only from the trans entrance of pores inserted from the cis side of a bilayer. Analysis of the binding kinetics shows that there is a single binding site for betaCD, with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant that varies by >100-fold under the conditions explored. The dissociation rate constant for the neutral betaCD molecule varies with pH and voltage, a result that is incompatible with two states of the alphaHL pore, one of high and the other of low affinity.

In contrast, ink-jet printing, used in low-cost desktop printers, patterns material by depositing microscopic droplets under robotic control in a programmable and inexpensive manner. We report the use of ink-jet printing to fabricate neuron-adhesive patterns such as islands and other shapes using poly(ethylene) glycol as the cell-repulsive material and a collagen/poly- d -lysine (PDL) mixture as the cell-adhesive material. We show that dissociated rat hippocampal neurons and glia grown at low densities on such patterns retain strong pattern adherence for over 25 days. The patterned neurons are comparable to control, un-patterned cells in electrophysiological properties and in immunocytochemical measurements of synaptic density and inhibitory cell distributions. We suggest that an inexpensive desktop printer may be an accessible tool for making micro-island cultures and other basic patterns.

Improvements in the efficiency of nucleic acid delivery in vivo are important for the development of DNA- and RNA-based therapeutics. Presently, most efforts to improve the condensation and delivery of nucleic acids have focused on the synthesis of novel condensing agents. However, short oligonucleotides are not as easy to condense into well-defined particles as gene-length DNA polymers and present particular challenges for discrete particle formation. We describe a novel strategy for improving the condensation and packaging of oligonucleotides that is based on the self-organization of half-sliding complementary oligonucleotides into long duplexes (ca. 2 kb). These non-covalent assemblies possess single-stranded nicks or single-stranded gaps at regular intervals along the duplex backbones. The condensation behavior of nicked- and gapped-DNA duplexes was investigated using several cationic condensing agents. Transmission electron microscopy and light-scattering studies reveal that these DNA duplexes condense much more readily than short duplex oligonucleotides (i.e. 21 bp), and more easily than a 3 kb plasmid DNA. The polymeric condensing agents, poly-l-lysine and polyethylenimine, form condensates with nicked- and gapped-DNA that are significantly smaller than condensates formed by the 3 kb plasmid DNA. These results demonstrate the ability for DNA structure and topology to alter nucleic acid condensation and suggest the potential for the use of this form of DNA in the design of vectors for oligonucleotide and gene delivery.

Three rounds of shuffling and selection resulted in cells that grew in up to 0.5 M arsenate, a 40-fold increase in resistance.

In the absence of shuffling, no increase in resistance was observed after four selection cycles, and the control plasmid remained episomal. The integrated ars operon had 13 mutations. Ten mutations were located in arsB, encoding the arsenite membrane pump, resulting in a fourfold to sixfold increase in arsenite resistance. While arsC, the arsenate reductase gene, contained no mutations, its expression level was increased, and the rate of arsenate reduction was increased 12-fold. These results show that DNA shuffling can improve the function of pathways by complex and unexpected mutational mechanisms that may be activated by point mutation.

Each droplet resides within an individual compartment and is positioned on a fixed electrode built into the solid substrate. Full encapsulation of the network is achieved with a solid cap that inserts into the substrate to form a closed volume. Encapsulated networks provide increased portability over unencapsulated networks by limiting droplet movement and through the integration of fixed electrodes into the supporting fixture. The formation of encapsulated droplet interface bilayers constructed from diphytanoyl phosphocoline (DPhPC) phospholipids is confirmed with electrical impedance spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry is used to measure the effect of alamethicin channels incorporated into the resulting lipid bilayers. The durability of the networks is quantified using a mechanical shaker to oscillate the bilayer in a direction transverse to the plane of the membrane and the results show that single droplet interface bilayers can withstand 1–10g of acceleration prior to bilayer failure. Observed failure modes include both droplet separation and bilayer rupturing, where the geometry of the supporting substrate and the presence of integrated electrodes are key contributors.

After in vitro transcription and translation, a pool of protein–DNA complexes is formed where each protein is stably associated with the DNA that encodes it. These complexes are amenable to the affinity selection of ligands to targets of interest. Here we show that RepA is a highly faithful cis-acting DNA-binding protein and demonstrate that libraries encoding >1012 random 18-mer peptides can be constructed and used to isolate peptides that bind specifically to disparate targets.

One species, denoted 80K-20K, is singly cleaved within the region of the polypeptide chain between amino acids 172 and 180. The second species, denoted 80K, is generated by extensive proteolysis of the N-terminal 20K domain by trypsin. The 80K-20K form is fully active in initiation and escape from abortive cycling. It is deficient only in processivity on long DNA templates. Likewise, the 80K species shows initiation kinetics and abortive product synthesis similar to those of the native enzyme. This latter species, however, is unable to escape abortive cycling and shows no synthesis of transcripts longer than about eight bases. Studies of RNA and DNA binding to the three different forms of the enzyme by gel retention assays reveal that the native (98K), the 80K-20K, and the 80K species all form specific complexes with promoter-containing DNA. In addition, the native enzyme binds nonspecifically to double-stranded DNA, while the 80K-20K and 80K enzymes do not. The native enzyme also binds RNA. This RNA binding is reduced in the 80K-20K enzyme and is absent in the 80K species. We suggest a model for T7 RNA polymerase wherein the 20K N-terminal domain of the protein or a shared region between the N- and the C-terminal domains of the protein forms a nonspecific polynucleotide binding site. Binding of the nascent mRNA to such a site may be involved in the observed transition of the native enzyme from the newly initiated complex, susceptible to abortive cycling, to a more stable highly processive ternary complex.",27,"DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/metabolism; Molecular Weight; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/metabolism; Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism; Promoter Regions, Genetic; RNA/metabolism; Structure-Activity Relationship; T-Phages/enzymology; Transcription, Genetic",DNA-Binding Proteins; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides; RNA; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases; Peptide Hydrolases,http://www.chem.umass.edu/people/cmartin/Pubs/PDF/Muller_8020T7RP_BCH88.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2460133,3,2460133,10.1021/bi00415a055,2112816891,

For example, the shared possession of a transferred gene indicates a phylogenetic relationship among organismal lineages by virtue of their shared common ancestral recipient. Here, we present phylogenetic analyses of prolyl-tRNA and alanyl-tRNA synthetase genes that indicate lateral gene transfer events to an ancestor of the diplomonads and parabasalids from lineages more closely related to the newly discovered archaeal hyperthermophile Nanoarchaeum equitans (Nanoarchaeota) than to Crenarchaeota or Euryarchaeota. The support for this scenario is strong from all applied phylogenetic methods for the alanyl-tRNA sequences, whereas the phylogenetic analyses of the prolyl-tRNA sequences show some disagreements between methods, indicating that the donor lineage cannot be identified with a high degree of certainty. However, in both trees, the diplomonads and parabasalids branch together within the Archaea, strongly suggesting that these two groups of unicellular eukaryotes, often regarded as the two earliest independent offshoots of the eukaryotic lineage, share a common ancestor to the exclusion of the eukaryotic root. Unfortunately, the phylogenetic analyses of these two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase genes are inconclusive regarding the position of the diplomonad/parabasalid group within the eukaryotes. Our results also show that the lineage leading to Nanoarchaeota branched off from Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota before the divergence of diplomonads and parabasalids, that this unexplored archaeal diversity, currently only represented by the hyperthermophilic organism Nanoarchaeum equitans, may include members living in close proximity to mesophilic eukaryotes, and that the presence of split genes in the Nanoarchaeum genome is a derived feature.",22,"Alanine-tRNA Ligase/chemistry; Amino Acyl-tRNA Synthetases/chemistry; Animals; Archaea/genetics; Cell Lineage; Diplomonadida/enzymology; Eukaryota/enzymology; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Transfer, Horizontal; Molecular Sequence Data; Nanoarchaeota/enzymology; Phylogeny",Amino Acyl-tRNA Synthetases; prolyl T RNA synthetase; Alanine-tRNA Ligase,http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/1/85.full.pdf+html?frame=sidebar http://paperity.org/p/54241806/gene-transfers-from-nanoarchaeota-to-an-ancestor-of-diplomonads-and-parabasalids http://swepub.kb.se/bib/swepub:oai:DiVA.org:uu-76100?language=en http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:104011 https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/22/1/85/973655 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15356278,1,15356278,10.1093/molbev/msh254,2115787055,

During the past decade, several strategies have been developed to screen (poly)peptide libraries for diverse applications including disease diagnosis and profiling, imaging, as well as therapy. The recently established baculovirus display vector system (BDVS) represents a eukaryotic screening platform that combines the positive attributes of both cell and virus-based display approaches, allowing presentation of complex polypeptides on cellular and viral surfaces. Compared to microbial display systems, the BDVS has the advantage of correct protein folding and post-translational modifications similar to those in mammals, facilitating expression and analysis of proteins with therapeutic interest. The applicability of the system is further expanded by the availability of genetically engineered insect cell lines capable of performing e.g. mammalianized glycosylation in combination with high level of expression. In addition to insect cells, baculovirus can mediate delivery and expression of heterologous genes in a broad spectrum of primary and established mammalian cells. Currently, a variety of baculovirus-based assays aiming at routine high throughput identification of agents targeting cell surface receptors or studies on ligand-receptor interactions are under construction. Here, the advancements and future prospects of the baculovirus display technologies with emphasis on molecular screening and drug delivery applications using insect cell display, mammalian cell display, and virion display are described.",11,"Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology; Animals; Baculoviridae/genetics; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods; Gene Library; Gene Transfer Techniques; Genetic Vectors/genetics; Humans; Insecta/virology","Adjuvants, Immunologic",http://www.eurekaselect.com/66466 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18336202,2,18336202,10.2174/138620708783744525,2075657675,

Eukaryotic cells have developed an evolutionarily conserved adaptive mechanism, the unfolded protein response (UPR), which aims to clear unfolded proteins and restore ER homeostasis. In cases where ER stress cannot be reversed, cellular functions deteriorate, often leading to cell death. Accumulating evidence implicates ER stress-induced cellular dysfunction and cell death as major contributors to many diseases, making modulators of ER stress pathways potentially attractive targets for therapeutics discovery.

We demonstrated that different marker densities can be attained by choice of restriction enzyme. Furthermore, we developed a barcoding system for sample multiplexing and fine mapped the genetic basis of lateral plate armor loss in threespine stickleback by identifying recombinant breakpoints in F2 individuals. Barcoding also facilitated mapping of a second trait, a reduction of pelvic structure, by in silico re-sorting of individuals. To further demonstrate the ease of the RAD sequencing approach we identified polymorphic markers and mapped an induced mutation in Neurospora crassa.

These inverted repeat sequences overlap the promoter of the rep B gene, which encodes a protein (RepB) essential for plasmid replication. Gel retardation assays, using lactococcal crude cell extracts in which RepB was overproduced, were used to demonstrate that the replication protein interacts with DNA sequences within the origin region. IR1 was identified as a RepB binding site. The −35 region of the rep B promoter is contained within the loop of the potential stem–loop structure of IR1, suggesting autoregulation of rep B. The pCI305 RepB failed to interact with DNA sequences within the minimal replicons of nine other members of the pCI305 family of plasmids and it was concluded that this DNA–protein interaction was replicon specific. In vivo studies were performed to determine the role of the three-and-one-half copies of the 22-bp sequences.

In the present study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to replace these structurally strategic residues in CbADH with the corresponding amino acids from TbADH, and we determined the effect of such replacements on the thermal stability of CbADH. Mutations in the intrasubunit ion pair region increased thermostability in the single mutant S254K- and in the double mutant V224E/S254K-CbADH, but not in the single mutant V224E-CbADH. Both single amino acid replacements, M304R- and Q165E-CbADH, in the region of the intersubunit ion pair network augmented thermal stability, with an additive effect in the double mutant M304R/Q165E-CbADH. To investigate the precise mechanism by which such mutations alter the molecular structure of CbADH to achieve enhanced thermostability, we constructed a quadruple mutant V224E/S254K/Q165E/M304R-CbADH and solved its three-dimensional structure. The overall results indicate that the amino acid substitutions in CbADH mutants with enhanced thermal stability reinforce the quaternary structure of the enzyme by formation of an extended network of intersubunit ion pairs and salt bridges, mediated by water molecules, and by forming a new intrasubunit salt bridge.",11,"Alcohol Dehydrogenase/chemistry; Amino Acid Sequence; Circular Dichroism; Clostridium/enzymology; Crystallography, X-Ray; Enzyme Stability; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Protein Structure, Quaternary; Protein Subunits/chemistry; Salts/chemistry; Sequence Alignment; Temperature",Protein Subunits; Salts; Alcohol Dehydrogenase,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/12381840 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2373725 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1110/ps.0222102/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12381840 https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1JQB,3,12381840,10.1110/ps.0222102,2005539780,

These mutants show altered incompatibility properties and increased copy numbers. Each mutant has a single base change at or near the center of one of the three palindromes in the region that specifies two RNA species: a larger one (primer transcripts) that provides a primer for DNA replication and a smaller one (RNA I) that is the incompatibility-specific inhibitor of primer formation. In vitro transcription studies show that the single base changes affect both the ability of RNA I to inhibit primer formation and the sensitivity of primer formation to inhibition by RNA I. RNA I hybridizes to the primer transcript, and the rate of hybridization is reduced by the single base changes. Based on analyses of inhibition of in vitro primer formation by RNA I and of in vivo properties of the mutant plasmids, we conclude that incompatibility between two plasmids can be attributed to inhibition of primer formation on one of the plasmids by the RNA I of the other.

Building on previous work (Jinek et al., 2013), we show here that new genetic information can be introduced site-specifically and with high efficiency by homology-directed repair (HDR) of Cas9-induced site-specific double-strand DNA breaks using timed delivery of Cas9-guide RNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Cas9 RNP-mediated HDR in HEK293T, human primary neonatal fibroblast and human embryonic stem cells was increased dramatically relative to experiments in unsynchronized cells, with rates of HDR up to 38% observed in HEK293T cells. Sequencing of on- and potential off-target sites showed that editing occurred with high fidelity, while cell mortality was minimized. This approach provides a simple and highly effective strategy for enhancing site-specific genome engineering in both transformed and primary human cells.",3,"Base Sequence; Cell Cycle/genetics; Cell Survival; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; DNA/chemistry; DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded; Embryo, Mammalian; Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology; Endonucleases/genetics; Fibroblasts/cytology; Gene Expression; Gene Transfer Techniques; Genetic Engineering/methods; Genome, Human; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Molecular Sequence Data; RNA, Guide/chemistry; Recombinational DNA Repair; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Signal Transduction; Staphylococcus/chemistry; Time Factors","RNA, Guide; DNA; Endonucleases",http://elifesciences.org/lookup/doi/10.7554/eLife.04766 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/25497837 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4383097 http://paperity.org/p/73764299/enhanced-homology-directed-human-genome-engineering-by-controlled-timing-of-crispr-cas9 https://elifesciences.org/articles/04766 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4383097/,25,25497837,10.7554/elife.04766,2163248265,PMC4383097

One potential biopesticide is the insect molting enzyme, chitinase, which degrades chitin to low molecular weight, soluble and insoluble oligosaccharides. For several years, our laboratories have been characterizing this enzyme and its gene. Most recently, we have been developing chitinase for use as a biopesticide to control insect and also fungal pests. Chitinases have been isolated from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta , and several other insect species, and some of their chemical, physical, and kinetic properties have been determined. Also, cDNA and genomic clones for the chitinase from the hornworm have been isolated and characterized. Transgenic plants that express hornworm chitinase constitutively have been generated and found to exhibit host plant resistance. A transformed entomopathogenic virus that produces the enzyme displayed enhanced insecticidal activity. Chitinase also potentiated the efficacy of the toxin from the microbial insecticide, Bacillus thuringiensis . Insect chitinase and its gene are now available for biopesticidal applications in integrated pest management programs.

This publication describes more detailed work on AXE I and its gene. AXE I binds cellulose but not xylan; it is glycosylated and inactivated by phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, showing that it is a serine esterase. The axe1 gene presents an open reading frame of 1278 bp, including two introns of 68 and 61 bp; it codes for a signal peptide of 31 residues and a mature protein of 351 amino acids (molecular weight 36,693). AXE I has a modular structure: a catalytic module at the amino terminus belonging to family 1 of the carbohydrate esterases, a linker rich in serines and threonines, and a family 1 carboxy terminal carbohydrate binding module (CBM). The CBM is similar to that of AXE from Trichoderma reesei , (with a family 5 catalytic module) indicating that the genes for catalytic modules and CBMs have evolved separately, and that they have been linked by gene fusion. The promoter sequence of axe1 contains several putative sequences for binding of gene expression regulators also found in other family 1 esterase gene promoters. It is proposed that AXE I and II act in succession in xylan degradation; first, xylan is attacked by AXE I and other xylanases possessing CBMs (which facilitate binding to lignocellulose), followed by other enzymes acting mainly on soluble substrates.",110,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095375620600219X http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17008082 https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/372019 https://researchers.unab.cl/es/publications/penicillium-purpurogenum-produces-a-family-1-acetyl-xylan-esteras https://udesantiago.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/penicillium-purpurogenum-produces-a-family-1-acetyl-xylan-esteras https://unab.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/penicillium-purpurogenum-produces-a-family-1-acetyl-xylan-esteras https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095375620600219X,6,,10.1016/j.mycres.2006.07.003,2019486748,

We have established a scalable technique to compare two biological samples for the levels of all pairwise interactions among a set of targeted protein molecules. The technique is a combination of the proximity ligation assay with readout via dual tag microarrays. In the proximity ligation assay protein identities are encoded as DNA sequences by attaching DNA oligonucleotides to antibodies directed against the proteins of interest. Upon binding by pairs of antibodies to proteins present in the same molecular complexes, ligation reactions give rise to reporter DNA molecules that contain the combined sequence information from the two DNA strands. The ligation reactions also serve to incorporate a sample barcode in the reporter molecules to allow for direct comparison between pairs of samples. The samples are evaluated using a dual tag microarray where information is decoded, revealing which pairs of tags that have become joined. As a proof-of-concept we demonstrate that this approach can be used to detect a set of five proteins and their pairwise interactions both in cellular lysates and in fixed tissue culture cells.

Court,"Homologous recombination can be used to generate recombinants on episomes or directly on the Escherichia coli chromosome with PCR products or synthetic single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotides (oligos). Such recombination is possible because bacteriophage λ-encoded functions, called Red, efficiently recombine linear DNA with homologies as short as 20–70 bases. This technology, termed recombineering, provides ways to modify genes and segments of the chromosome as well as to study homologous recombination mechanisms. The Red Beta function, which binds and anneals ssDNA to complementary ssDNA, is able to recombine 70-base oligos with the chromosome. In E. coli, methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) can affect these ssDNA recombination events by eliminating the recombinant allele and restoring the original sequence. In so doing, MMR can reduce the apparent recombination frequency by >100-fold. In the absence of MMR, Red-mediated oligo recombination can incorporate a single base change into the chromosome in an unprecedented 25% of cells surviving electroporation.

Full-length cDNAs encoding the enzyme were isolated from an A. aculeatus cDNA library using a polymerase chain reaction-generated product as a probe. The 936-base pair rha1 cDNA encodes a 250-residue precursor protein of 26,350 Da, including a 17-amino acid signal peptide. The rha1 cDNA was overexpressed in Aspergillus oryzae, a filamentous fungus that does not possess RGAE activity, and the recombinant enzyme was purified and characterized. Mass spectrometry of the native and recombinant RGAE revealed that the enzymes are heterogeneously glycosylated. In addition, the observed differences in their molecular masses, lectin binding patterns, and monosaccharide compositions indicate that the glycan moieties on the two enzymes are structurally different. The RGAE was shown to act in synergy with rhamnogalacturonase A as well as rhamnogalacturonase B from A. aculeatus in the degradation of apple pectin rhamnogalacturonan.

The Cas9 nuclease from the microbial CRISPR-Cas system is targeted to specific genomic loci by a 20 nt guide sequence, which can tolerate certain mismatches to the DNA target and thereby promote undesired off-target mutagenesis. Here, we describe an approach that combines a Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs to introduce targeted double-strand breaks. Because individual nicks in the genome are repaired with high fidelity, simultaneous nicking via appropriately offset guide RNAs is required for double-stranded breaks and extends the number of specifically recognized bases for target cleavage. We demonstrate that using paired nicking can reduce off-target activity by 50- to 1,500-fold in cell lines and to facilitate gene knockout in mouse zygotes without sacrificing on-target cleavage efficiency. This versatile strategy enables a wide variety of genome editing applications that require high specificity.",154,"Animals; Base Sequence; DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded; Gene Targeting/methods; Genome; Mice; Molecular Sequence Data; RNA, Guide/genetics; Streptococcus pyogenes/enzymology; Zygote/metabolism","RNA, Guide",http://www.cell.com/article/S0092867413010155/abstract http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23992846 http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(13)01015-5 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867413010155 http://zhanglab.tch.harvard.edu/2013papers/8.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3856256 https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/29797 https://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(13)01015-5 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3856256/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867413010155 https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Double-Nicking-by-RNA-Guided-CRISPR-Cas9-for-Genome-Ran-Hsu/0be119ce0687e7a6281b7bd7e6ed9161d127903f http://hsu.salk.edu/papers/Ran_FA_Cell_2013.pdf http://knockout.cwru.edu/publications/rancrispr.pdf http://ko.case.edu/publications/RanCRISPR.pdf http://ko.cwru.edu/publications/rancrispr.pdf http://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/29797/cdc_29797_DS3.pdf http://zlab.mit.edu/assets/reprints/Ran_FA_Cell_2013.pdf,162,23992846,10.1016/j.cell.2013.08.021,2167380395,PMC3856256

Santi,"To exploit the huge potential of whole-genome sequence information, the ability to efficiently synthesize long, accurate DNA sequences is becoming increasingly important. An approach proposed toward this end involves the synthesis of ≈5-kb segments of DNA, followed by their assembly into longer sequences by conventional cloning methods [Smith, H. O., Hutchinson, C. A., III, Pfannkoch, C. & Venter, J. C. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100, 15440–15445]. The major current impediment to the success of this tactic is the difficulty of building the ≈5-kb components accurately, efficiently, and rapidly from short synthetic oligonucleotide building blocks. We have developed and implemented a strategy for the high-throughput synthesis of long, accurate DNA sequences. Unpurified 40-base synthetic oligonucleotides are built into 500- to 800-bp “synthons” with low error frequency by automated PCR-based gene synthesis. By parallel processing, these synthons are efficiently joined into multisynthon ≈5-kb segments by using only three endonucleases and “ligation by selection.” These large segments can be subsequently assembled into very long sequences by conventional cloning. We validated the approach by building a synthetic 31,656-bp polyketide synthase gene cluster whose functionality was demonstrated by its ability to produce the megaenzyme and its polyketide product in Escherichia coli.",101,"Base Sequence; DNA, Bacterial/biosynthesis; Escherichia coli/enzymology; Genes, Bacterial; Genetic Vectors; Methods; Molecular Sequence Data; Multigene Family; Open Reading Frames; Polyketide Synthases/genetics","DNA, Bacterial; Polyketide Synthases",http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004PNAS..10115573K http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC524854/ http://www.pnas.org/content/101/44/15573.full https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=1055418 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15496466 http://www.pnas.org/content/101/44/15573.full.pdf,71,15496466,10.1073/pnas.0406911101,2035673487,

The capacitive nature of the membrane is also; used in a dynamic sensing application, whereby the perturbation of an artificial hair structure induces bending; in a bilayer formed at the base of the hair. This oscillation results in a time-varying membrane capacitance that; in turn produces an electrical current on the order of 1 - 100pA.

The position of the ald gene in C. beijerinckii NRRL B593 corresponded to that of the aad/adhE gene (encoding an aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase) of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and DSM 792. In Southern analyses, a probe derived from the C. acetobutylicum aad/adhE gene did not hybridize to restriction fragments of the genomic DNAs of C. beijerinckii and two other species of solvent-producing clostridia. In contrast, a probe derived from the C. beijerinckii ald gene hybridized to restriction fragments of the genomic DNA of three solvent-producing species but not to those of C. acetobutylicum, indicating a key difference among the solvent-producing clostridia. The amino acid sequence of the ALDH of C. beijerinckii NRRL B593 was most similar (41% identity) to those of the eutE gene products (CoA-acylating ALDHs) of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, whereas it was about 26% identical to the ALDH domain of the aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenases of C. acetobutylicum, E. coli, Lactococcus lactis, and amitochondriate protozoa. The predicted secondary structure of the C. beijerinckii ALDH suggests the presence of an atypical Rossmann fold for NAD+ binding. A comparison of the proposed catalytic pockets of the CoA-dependent and CoA-independent ALDHs identified 6 amino acids that may contribute to interaction with CoA.",65,"Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/chemistry; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Clostridium/classification; Genes, Bacterial; Macromolecular Substances; Molecular Sequence Data; Open Reading Frames; Peptide Fragments/chemistry; Rats; Restriction Mapping; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Species Specificity",Macromolecular Substances; Peptide Fragments; Aldehyde Oxidoreductases; acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acylating),http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/instance/91669/figure/F3/ http://aem.asm.org/content/65/11/4973.full http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC91669 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=469894 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10543811 http://aem.asm.org/content/65/11/4973.full.pdf,37,10543811,,1513312119,

We discuss the experimental constraints to synthesize the most elementary cell-sized compartment that can self-reproduce using synthetic genetic information. The original idea was to program a phospholipid vesicle with DNA. Based on this idea, it was shown that in vitro gene expression could be carried out inside cell-sized synthetic vesicles. It was also shown that a couple of genes could be expressed for a few days inside the vesicles once the exchanges of nutrients with the outside environment were adequately introduced. The development of a cell-free transcription/translation toolbox allows the expression of a large number of genes with multiple transcription factors. As a result, the development of a synthetic DNA program is becoming one of the main hurdles. We discuss the various possibilities to enrich and to replicate this program. Defining a program for self-reproduction remains a difficult question as nongenetic processes, such as molecular self-organization, play an essential and complementary role. The synthesis of a stable compartment with an active interface, one of the critical bottlenecks in the synthesis of artificial cell, depends on the properties of phospholipid membranes.

The mobM gene was removed in the construction of the pMV158-derivative plasmid pLS1, which was used in this study. By in vitro transcription assays, primer extension experiments, and construction of mutations, here we demonstrate the presence of another gene (the sixth of pMV158), termed maI, which is transcribed in opposite orientation with respect to the plasmid mRNAs, to render RNA I. The 5′-end of RNA I has an 8-nt sequence which is complementary to a region of the lagging-strand origin ( ssoA ) comprising a 6-nt consensus sequence involved in lagging strand synthesis. This suggested that RNA I could influence, positively or negatively, initiation of lagging strand synthesis from the pLS1- ssoA. However, plasmids defective in RNA I synthesis exhibited a phenotype similar to the wild type in terms of efficiency of replication from the ssoA and copy number. When the maI gene was cloned into a compatible plasmid, the resulting recombinants did not exhibit incompatibility toward plasmids with the pLS1 replicon. Thus, RNA I does not seem to be a true copy number control element. We postulate that transcription from the maI promoter may facilitate extrusion of the hairpin of the plasmid double-strand origin, which is the target of the initiator of replication protein.",40,"Base Sequence; DNA Replication; DNA, Bacterial/genetics; DNA, Single-Stranded/metabolism; Genes, Bacterial; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Plasmids/genetics; RNA, Bacterial/genetics; Streptococcus pneumoniae/genetics; Transcription, Genetic","DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Single-Stranded; RNA, Bacterial",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147619X98913701 https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9806858 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147619X98913701,1,9806858,10.1006/plas.1998.1370,1985324715,

We used site-directed mutagenesis to replace eight complementary residue positions in CBADH, one residue at a time, with proline. All eight single-proline mutants and a double-proline mutant of CBADH were enzymatically active. The critical sites for increasing thermostability parameters in CBADH were Leu-316 and Ser-24, and to a lesser degree, Ala-347. Substituting proline for His-222, Leu-275, and Thr-149, however, reduced thermal stability parameters. Our results show that the thermal stability of the mesophilic CBADH can be moderately enhanced by substituting proline at strategic positions analogous to nonconserved prolines in the homologous thermophilic TBADH. The proline residues that appear to be crucial for the increased thermal stability of CBADH are located at a beta-turn and a terminating external loop in the polypeptide chain. Positioning proline at the N-caps of alpha-helices in CBADH led to adverse effects on thermostability, whereas single-proline mutations in other positions in the polypeptide had varying effects on thermal parameters. The finding presented here support the idea that at least two of the eight extra prolines in TBADH contribute to its thermal stability.",7,"Alcohol Dehydrogenase/chemistry; Amino Acid Sequence; Amino Acid Substitution; Bacteria, Anaerobic/enzymology; Clostridium/enzymology; Enzyme Stability; Gram-Positive Asporogenous Rods, Irregular/enzymology; Molecular Sequence Data; Proline/metabolism; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid",Proline; Alcohol Dehydrogenase,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/9836874 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2144005 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pro.5560070509/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9836874,5,9836874,10.1002/pro.5560070509,2031778321,

The Argonaute of the archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (PfAgo) belongs to a different branch in the phylogenetic tree, which is most closely related to that of RNA interference-mediating eukaryotic Argonautes. Here we describe a functional and mechanistic characterization of PfAgo. Like the bacterial counterparts, archaeal PfAgo contributes to host defense by interfering with the uptake of plasmid DNA. PfAgo utilizes small 5′-phosphorylated DNA guides to cleave both single stranded and double stranded DNA targets, and does not utilize RNA as guide or target. Thus, with respect to function and specificity, the archaeal PfAgo resembles bacterial Argonautes much more than eukaryotic Argonautes. These findings demonstrate that the role of Argonautes is conserved through the bacterial and archaeal domains of life and suggests that eukaryotic Argonautes are derived from DNA-guided DNA-interfering host defense systems.",43,"Archaeal Proteins/chemistry; Argonaute Proteins/chemistry; Catalytic Domain; DNA/metabolism; DNA Cleavage; Endodeoxyribonucleases/chemistry; Plasmids/genetics; Pyrococcus furiosus/enzymology; Transformation, Genetic",Archaeal Proteins; Argonaute Proteins; DNA; Endodeoxyribonucleases,http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/04/28/nar.gkv415.full http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/25925567 http://edepot.wur.nl/372439 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4446448 http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/496100 http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/04/28/nar.gkv415.full.pdf http://paperity.org/p/73000888/argonaute-of-the-archaeon-pyrococcus-furiosus-is-a-dna-guided-nuclease-that-targets https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/43/10/5120/2409785 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Alibrary.wur.nl%3Awurpubs%2F496100 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4446448/,11,25925567,10.1093/nar/gkv415,2038482997,PMC4446448

Twenty-three of 32 mutants exhibit high lactose accumulation (70-100% or more of C-less), and an additional 8 mutants accumulate to lower but highly significant levels. Surprisingly, Cys replacement for Gly-24 or Tyr-26 yields fully active permease molecules, and permease with Cys in place of Pro-28 also exhibits significant transport activity, although previous mutagenesis studies on these residues suggested that they may be required for lactose transport. As expected, Cys replacement for Pro-31 completely inactivates, in agreement with previous findings indicating that ""helix-breaking"" propensity at this position is necessary for full activity (Consler TG, Tsolas O, Kaback HR, 1991, Biochemistry 30:1291-1297). Twenty-nine mutants are present in the membrane in amounts comparable to C-less permease, whereas membrane levels of mutants Tyr-3-->Cys and Phe-12-->Cys are slightly reduced, as judged by immunological techniques.

Flick; Melissa S. Jurica; Raymond J. Monnat; Barry L. Stoddard,"Homing endonucleases are a diverse collection of proteins that are encoded by genes with mobile, self-splicing introns 1-3 . They have also been identified in self-splicing inteins (protein introns)4. These enzymes promote the movement of the DNA sequences that encode them from one chromosome location to another; they do this by making a site-specific double-strand break at a target site in an allele that lacks the corresponding mobile intron 3 . The target sites recognized by these small endonucleases are generally long (14-44 base pairs). Four families of homing endonucleases have been identified, including the LAGLIDADG, the His-Cys box, the GIY-YIG and the H-N-H endonucleases'. The first identified His-Cys box homing endonuclease was I-PpoI from the slime mould Physarum polycephalum 5,6 . Its gene resides in one of only a few nuclear introns known to exhibit genetic mobility7. Here we report the structure of the I-PpoI homing endonuclease bound to homing-site DNA determined to 1.8 A resolution. I-PpoI displays an: elongated fold of dimensions 25 x 35 x 80 A, with mixed α/β topology. Each I-PpoI monomer contains three antiparallel β-sheets flanked by two long α-helices and a long carboxy-terminal tail, and is stabilized by two bound zinc ions 15 A apart. The enzyme possesses a new zinc-bound fold and endonuclease active site. The structure has been determined in both uncleaved substrate and cleaved product complexes. The structure of I-PpoI (Fig. 1) shows that the central interface of the enzyme dimer is small and highly solvated, with subunit contacts that bury only approximately 700 A 2 of surface area (Fig. 2a).The C-terminal tails (residues 146-163) are domain-swapped and extend 34 A across opposite monomers, burying an additional 900 A 2 per subunit (Fig. 2b). In contrast to the LAGLIDADG homing endonucleases 8,9 , the I-PpoI dimer interface is not tightly packed.",394,"Amino Acid Sequence; Binding Sites; Crystallography, X-Ray; DNA/metabolism; DNA-Binding Proteins; Endodeoxyribonucleases/chemistry; Introns; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Molecular Structure; Sequence Alignment; Zinc/metabolism",DNA-Binding Proteins; DNA; Endodeoxyribonucleases; I-Ppo endonuclease; Zinc,http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998Natur.394...96F http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/27952 http://labs.fhcrc.org/stoddard/papers/flick_etal_nature98.pdf http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/27952 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=454713 https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9665136 https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1A74 http://depts.washington.edu/monnatws/pdf/1998_Flick.pdf,12,9665136,10.1038/27952,2106173982,

Such an endeavor will require improvements in the throughputs and costs of DNA sequencing. Next-generation sequencing platforms have impressively low costs and high throughputs but are limited by short read lengths. An immediate and widely recognized solution to this critical limitation is the paired-end tag (PET) sequencing for various applications, collectively called the PET sequencing strategy, in which short and paired tags are extracted from the ends of long DNA fragments for ultra-high-throughput sequencing. The PET sequences can be accurately mapped to the reference genome, thus demarcating the genomic boundaries of PET-represented DNA fragments and revealing the identities of the target DNA elements. PET protocols have been developed for the analyses of transcriptomes, transcription factor binding sites, epigenetic sites such as histone modification sites, and genome structures. The exclusive advantage of the PET technology is its ability to uncover linkages between the two ends of DNA fragments. Using this unique feature, unconventional fusion transcripts, genome structural variations, and even molecular interactions between distant genomic elements can be unraveled by PET analysis. Extensive use of PET data could lead to efficient assembly of individual human genomes, transcriptomes, and interactomes, enabling new biological and clinical insights. With its versatile and powerful nature for DNA analysis, the PET sequencing strategy has a bright future ahead.",19,"Gene Expression Profiling; Genomics; Humans; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Tagged Sites",,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/19339662 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3807531 http://genome.cshlp.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.074906.107 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3807531/,67,19339662,10.1101/gr.074906.107,2122056961,PMC3807531

The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs.

Biophysical and x-ray crystallographic studies of the three and four repeat constructs (3ANK and 4ANK) to 1.26 and 1.5 Å resolution, respectively, demonstrate that these proteins are well-folded, monomeric, display high thermostability, and adopt a very regular, tightly packed ankyrin repeat fold. Mapping the degree of amino acid conservation at each position on the 4ANK structure shows that most nonconserved residues are clustered on the surface of the molecule that has been designated as the binding site in naturally occurring ankyrin repeat proteins. Thus, the consensus amino acid sequence contains all information required to define the ankyrin repeat fold. Our results suggest that statistical analysis and the consensus sequence approach can be used as an effective method to design proteins with complex topologies.

The N-terminal half of the putative catalytic domain of CEL1 was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione- S -transferase. The fusion protein was used to raise a CEL1-specific antibody. CEL1 was detected as an extracellular 49.8 kDa protein in A. bisporus cellulose-grown cultures, where it bound strongly to cellulose. CEL1 was neither an endoglucanase, a cellobiohydrolase able to hydrolyze fluorogenic cellobiosides, a β-glucosidase, a xylanase, nor a cellobiose: quinone oxidoreductase.

Papoutsakis,"DNA microarray analysis of Clostridium acetobutylicum was used to examine the genomic-scale gene expression changes during the shift from exponential-phase growth and acidogenesis to stationary phase and solventogenesis. Self-organizing maps were used to identify novel expression patterns of functional gene classes, including aromatic and branched-chain amino acid synthesis, ribosomal proteins, cobalt and iron transporters, cobalamin biosynthesis, and lipid biosynthesis. The majority of pSOL1 megaplasmid genes (in addition to the solventogenic genes aad-ctfA-ctfB and adc) had increased expression at the onset of solventogenesis, suggesting that other megaplasmid genes may play a role in stationary-phase phenomena. Analysis of sporulation genes and comparison with published Bacillus subtilis results indicated conserved expression patterns of early sporulation genes, including spo0A, the sigF operon, and putative canonical genes of the σH and σF regulons. However, sigE expression could not be detected within 7.5 h of initial spo0A expression, consistent with the observed extended time between the appearance of clostridial forms and endospore formation. The results were compared with microarray comparisons of the wild-type strain and the nonsolventogenic, asporogenous M5 strain, which lacks the pSOL1 megaplasmid. While some results were similar, the expression of primary metabolism genes and heat shock proteins was higher in M5, suggesting a difference in metabolic regulation or a butyrate stress response in M5. The results of this microarray platform and analysis were further validated by comparing gene expression patterns to previously published Northern analyses, reporter assays, and two-dimensional protein electrophoresis data of metabolic genes (including all major solventogenesis genes), sporulation genes, heat shock proteins, and other solventogenesis-induced gene expression.",187,"Amino Acids/biosynthesis; Bacterial Proteins/genetics; Carbon-Sulfur Lyases; Clostridium acetobutylicum/genetics; Energy Metabolism/genetics; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Ions/metabolism; Lipid Metabolism; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Polysaccharides/genetics; Spores, Bacterial/genetics; Transcription, Genetic/physiology","Amino Acids; Bacterial Proteins; Ions; Polysaccharides; granulose; Carbon-Sulfur Lyases; LuxS protein, Bacteria",http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1251621 http://jb.asm.org/content/187/20/7103.full https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=1306005 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16199581 http://jb.asm.org/content/187/20/7103.full.pdf,10,16199581,10.1128/jb.187.20.7103-7118.2005,2146205446,

Anderson; Ronald Swanstrom,"Viruses can create complex genetic populations within a host, and deep sequencing technologies allow extensive sampling of these populations. Limitations of these technologies, however, potentially bias this sampling, particularly when a PCR step precedes the sequencing protocol. Typically, an unknown number of templates are used in initiating the PCR amplification, and this can lead to unrecognized sequence resampling creating apparent homogeneity; also, PCR-mediated recombination can disrupt linkage, and differential amplification can skew allele frequency. Finally, misincorporation of nucleotides during PCR and errors during the sequencing protocol can inflate diversity. We have solved these problems by including a random sequence tag in the initial primer such that each template receives a unique Primer ID. After sequencing, repeated identification of a Primer ID reveals sequence resampling. These resampled sequences are then used to create an accurate consensus sequence for each template, correcting for recombination, allelic skewing, and misincorporation/sequencing errors. The resulting population of consensus sequences directly represents the initial sampled templates. We applied this approach to the HIV-1 protease (pro) gene to view the distribution of sequence variation of a complex viral population within a host. We identified major and minor polymorphisms at coding and noncoding positions. In addition, we observed dynamic genetic changes within the population during intermittent drug exposure, including the emergence of multiple resistant alleles. These results provide an unprecedented view of a complex viral population in the absence of PCR resampling.",108,"Alleles; Base Sequence; Codon/genetics; DNA Primers/metabolism; DNA, Complementary/biosynthesis; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Viral/drug effects; Genes, Viral/genetics; Genetic Variation/drug effects; HIV Protease/genetics; HIV-1/drug effects; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods; Humans; Linkage Disequilibrium/genetics; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology; RNA, Viral/genetics; Templates, Genetic","Codon; DNA Primers; DNA, Complementary; Protease Inhibitors; RNA, Viral; HIV Protease; p16 protease, Human immunodeficiency virus 1",http://www.pnas.org/content/108/50/20166.full.pdf+html?with-ds=yes http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/23060093.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3250168 http://www.pnas.org/content/108/50/20166 https://uncch.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/accurate-sampling-and-deep-sequencing-of-the-hiv-1-protease-gene- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250168/ http://www.pnas.org/content/108/50/20166.full.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeffrey_Roach2/publication/51847735_Accurate_sampling_and_deep_sequencing_of_the_HIV-1_protease_gene_using_a_Primer_ID/links/53ff809c0cf24c81027da432.pdf,54,22135472,10.1073/pnas.1110064108,2163576465,PMC3250168

In this study, a riboswitch, a small regulatory element found in RNAs, was employed to reprogram microorganisms to produce valuable metabolites. A self-cleaving ribozyme glmS , found in gram-positive bacteria, cleaves its own transcript in response to the intracellular glucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcN6P) concentration. The glmS ribozyme was integrated into the 3′-untranslated region of FCY1 , which encodes cytosine deaminase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to construct a suicide riboswitch for evolutionary engineering. Growth of the strain harboring the suicide riboswitch was hampered by the addition of fluorocytosine, and was recovered as metabolite level increased. By using this riboswitch, we isolated a N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) producer strain by screening an efficient glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase (Gfa1p) and haloacid dehalogenase-like phosphatases (HAD phosphatases) originated from Escherichia coli . The suicide riboswitch was also applied to different metabolite by using artificial allosteric ribozyme.

We have generated stable, non-reverting l-form variants of the Gram-positive pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, and studied the cellular and molecular changes associated with this transition. Stable l-form cells can occur as small protoplast-like vesicles and as multinucleated, large bodies. They have lost the thick, multilayered murein sacculus and are surrounded by a cytoplasmic membrane only, although peptidoglycan precursors are still produced. While they lack murein-associated molecules including Internalin A, membrane-anchored proteins such as Internalin B are retained. Surprisingly, l-forms were found to be able to divide and propagate indefinitely without a wall. Time-lapse microscopy of fluorescently labelled l-forms indicated a switch to a novel form of cell division, where genome-containing membrane vesicles are first formed within enlarged l-forms, and subsequently released by collapse of the mother cell. Array-based transcriptomics of parent and l-form cells revealed manifold differences in expression of genes associated with morphological and physiological functions. The l-forms feature downregulated metabolic functions correlating with the dramatic shift in surface to volume ratio, whereas upregulation of stress genes reflects the difficulties in adapting to this unusual, cell wall-deficient lifestyle.",73,"Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins/metabolism; Cell Division; Cell Membrane/metabolism; Cell Wall/ultrastructure; Cytoplasmic Vesicles/metabolism; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; L Forms/cytology; Listeria monocytogenes/cytology; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; RNA, Bacterial/genetics; Sequence Analysis, DNA","Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins; RNA, Bacterial",http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1365-2958.2009.06774.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2958.2009.06774.x/full https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/6846445 https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/339441 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19555455,1,19555455,10.1111/j.1365-2958.2009.06774.x,2120649713,

Initial studies of ADH in extracts of several strains of Clostridium acetobutylicum and C. beijerinckii gave conflicting molecular properties. A more coherent picture has emerged because of the following results: (i) identification of ADHs with different coenzyme specificities in these species; (ii) discovery of structurally conserved ADHs (type 3) in three solvent-producing species; (iii) isolation of mutants with deficiencies in butanol production and restoration of butanol production with a cloned alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase gene; and (iv) resolution of various ‘ C. acetobutylicum ’ cultures into four species. The three ADH isozymes of C. beijerinckii NRRL B592 have high sequence similarities to ADH-1 of Clostridium sp. NCP 262 (formerly C. acetobutylicum P262) and to the ADH domain of the alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824/DSM 792. The NADH-dependent activity of the ADHs from C. beijerinckii NRRL B592 and the BDHs from C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 is profoundly affected by the pH of the assay, and the relative importance of NADH and NADPH to butanol production may be misappraised when NAD(P)H-dependent activities were measured at different pH values. The primary/secondary ADH of isopropanol-producing C. beijerinckii is a type-1 enzyme and is highly conserved in Thermoanaerobacter brockii (formerly Thermoanaerobium brockii ) and Entamoeba histolytica . Several solvent-forming enzymes (primary ADH, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase) are very similar between C. beijerinckii and the species represented by Clostridium sp. NCP 262 and NRRL B643. The realization of such relationships will facilitate the elucidation of the roles of different ADHs because each type of ADH can now be studied in an organism most amenable to experimental manipulations.",17,"Alcohol Dehydrogenase/chemistry; Amino Acid Sequence; Clostridium/enzymology; Molecular Sequence Data; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Solvents/metabolism",Solvents; Alcohol Dehydrogenase,http://doi.wiley.com/10.1016/0168-6445(95)00015-5 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168644595000155 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1574-6976.1995.tb00210.x/abstract https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/17/3/263/512123 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7576768 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168644595000155,5,7576768,10.1016/0168-6445(95)00015-5; 10.1111/j.1574-6976.1995.tb00210.x,2073170585,

The slot region surface architecture of the soybean cysteine proteinase inhibitor (soyacystatin N, scN) was engineered using techniques of in vitro molecular evolution to define residues that facilitate interaction with the proteinase cleft and modulate inhibitor affinity and function. Combinatorial phage display libraries of scN variants that contain mutations in the essential motifs of the first (QVVAG) and second (EW) hairpin-loop regions were constructed. Approximately 10 10 ‐10 11 phages expressing recombinant scN proteins were subjected to biopanning selection based on binding affinity to immobilized papain. The QVVAG motif in the first hairpin loop was invariant in all functional scN proteins. All selected variants (30) had W79 in the second hairpin-loop motif, but there was diversity for hydrophobic and basic amino acids in residue 78. Kinetic analysis of isolated scN variants identified a novel scN isoform scN(LW) with higher papain affinity than the wild-type molecule. The variant contained an E78L substitution and had a twofold lower K i (2.1 pM) than parental scN, due to its increased association rate constant (2.6 6 0.09 3 10 7 M ‐1 sec ‐1 ). These results define residues in the first and second hairpin-loop regions which are essential for optimal interaction between phytocystatins and papain, a prototypical cysteine proteinase.

The AID system is shown to be capable of controlling the stability of AID-tagged proteins that are in either nuclear or cytoplasmic compartments and even when incorporated into protein complexes. Induced degradation occurs rapidly after addition of auxin with protein half-life reduced to as little as 9 min and proceeding to completion with first-order kinetics. AID-mediated instability is demonstrated to be rapidly reversible.

The efficiency of this protocol allows generating libraries of recombinant genes by combining in one reaction several fragment sets prepared from different parental templates. As an example, we have applied this strategy for shuffling of trypsinogen from three parental templates (bovine cationic trypsinogen, bovine anionic trypsinogen and human cationic trypsinogen) each divided in 9 separate modules. We show that one round of shuffling using the 27 trypsinogen entry plasmids can easily produce the 19,683 different possible combinations in one single restriction-ligation and that expression screening of a subset of the library allows identification of variants that can lead to higher expression levels of trypsin activity.

SignalP consists of two different predictors based on neural network and hidden Markov model algorithms, where both components have been updated. Motivated by the idea that the cleavage site position and the amino acid composition of the signal peptide are correlated, new features have been included as input to the neural network. This addition, combined with a thorough error-correction of a new data set, have improved the performance of the predictor significantly over SignalP version 2. In version 3, correctness of the cleavage site predictions has increased notably for all three organism groups, eukaryotes, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The accuracy of cleavage site prediction has increased in the range 6‐17% over the previous version, whereas the signal peptide discrimination improvement is mainly due to the elimination of false-positive predictions, as well as the introduction of a new discrimination score for the neural network.

The application of in vitro translation to the synthesis of unnatural peptides may allow the production of extremely large libraries of highly modified peptides, which are a potential source of lead compounds in the search for new pharmaceutical agents. The specificity of the translation apparatus, however, limits the diversity of unnatural amino acids that can be incorporated into peptides by ribosomal translation. We have previously shown that over 90 unnatural amino acids can be enzymatically loaded onto tRNA. Methodology/Principal Findings. We have now used a competition assay to assess the efficiency of tRNA-aminoacylation of these analogs. We have also used a series of peptide translation assays to measure the efficiency with which these analogs are incorporated into peptides. The translation apparatus tolerates most side chain derivatives, a few a,a disubstituted, N-methyl and a-hydroxy derivatives, but no b-amino acids. We show that over 50 unnatural amino acids can be incorporated into peptides by ribosomal translation. Using a set of analogs that are efficiently charged and translated we were able to prepare individual peptides containing up to 13 different unnatural amino acids. Conclusions/Significance. Our results demonstrate that a diverse array of unnatural building blocks can be translationally incorporated into peptides.

Sialic acid (Sia) is an essential component of brain gangliosides and the polysialic acid (polySia) chains that modify neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAM). Sia levels are high in human breast milk, predominately as N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). In contrast, infant formulas contain a low level of Sia consisting of both Neu5Ac and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). Neu5Gc is implicated in some human inflammatory diseases. Brain gangliosides and polysialylated NCAM play crucial roles in cell-to-cell interactions, neuronal outgrowth, modifying synaptic connectivity, and memory formation.

Whether this is the most relevant endpoint for measuring miRNA inhibition has not been adequately addressed in the field although it has important implications for evaluating miRNA targeting studies. Using a novel approach to quantitate miRNA levels in the presence of excess ASO, we have discovered that the outcome of miRNA inhibition can vary depending on the chemical modification of the ASO. Although some miRNA inhibitors cause a decrease in mature miRNA levels, we have identified a novel 2′-fluoro/2′-methoxyethyl modified ASO motif with dramatically improved in vivo potency which does not.

Saier; M Steinmetz,"Abstract; In gram-positive bacteria, HPr, a phosphocarrier protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), is phosphorylated by an ATP-dependent, metabolite-activated protein kinase on seryl residue 46. In a Bacillus subtilis mutant strain in which Ser-46 of HPr was replaced with a nonphosphorylatable alanyl residue (ptsH1 mutation), synthesis of gluconate kinase, glucitol dehydrogenase, mannitol-1-P dehydrogenase and the mannitol-specific PTS permease was completely relieved from repression by glucose, fructose, or mannitol, whereas synthesis of inositol dehydrogenase was partially relieved from catabolite repression and synthesis of alpha-glucosidase and glycerol kinase was still subject to catabolite repression. When the S46A mutation in HPr was reverted to give S46 wild-type HPr, expression of gluconate kinase and glucitol dehydrogenase regained full sensitivity to repression by PTS sugars. These results suggest that phosphorylation of HPr at Ser-46 is directly or indirectly involved in catabolite repression. A strain deleted for the ptsGHI genes was transformed with plasmids expressing either the wild-type ptsH gene or various S46 mutant ptsH genes (S46A or S46D). Expression of the gene encoding S46D HPr, having a structure similar to that of P-ser-HPr according to nuclear magnetic resonance data, caused significant reduction of gluconate kinase activity, whereas expression of the genes encoding wild-type or S46A HPr had no effect on this enzyme activity. When the promoterless lacZ gene was put under the control of the gnt promoter and was subsequently incorporated into the amyE gene on the B. subtilis chromosome, expression of beta-galactosidase was inducible by gluconate and repressed by glucose. However, we observed no repression of beta-galactosidase activity in a strain carrying the ptsH1 mutation. Additionally, we investigated a ccpA mutant strain and observed that all of the enzymes which we found to be relieved from carbon catabolite repression in the ptsH1 mutant strain were also insensitive to catabolite repression in the ccpA mutant. Enzymes that were repressed in the ptsH1 mutant were also repressed in the ccpA mutant.",176,"Bacillus subtilis/enzymology; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; Enzyme Repression; Escherichia coli Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Genes, Bacterial/genetics; Gluconates/metabolism; Mannitol/metabolism; Molecular Sequence Data; Monosaccharide Transport Proteins; Mutation; Phosphoenolpyruvate Sugar Phosphotransferase System/analysis; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/analysis; Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics; Protein Kinases/metabolism; Sorbitol/metabolism; Sugar Alcohol Dehydrogenases/analysis","Bacterial Proteins; Escherichia coli Proteins; Gluconates; Monosaccharide Transport Proteins; Mannitol; Sorbitol; Sugar Alcohol Dehydrogenases; mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase; Protein Kinases; Phosphoenolpyruvate Sugar Phosphotransferase System; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor); mannitol PTS permease, E coli; phosphocarrier protein HPr; gluconokinase; gluconic acid",http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8195089 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC205505 http://jb.asm.org/content/176/11/3336.abstract?related-urls=yesl176/11/3336 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8195089 http://jb.asm.org/content/176/11/3336.full.pdf,4,8195089,10.1128/jb.176.11.3336-3344.1994,1587099738,

Some of the isolated cellulases were classified into known families of glycoside hydrolases: Cel6A (CBH II), Cel7A (CBH I), Cel12A (EG28), Cel45A (EG25). It was shown that EG44 and EG51 are two different forms of one enzyme. EG44 seems to be a catalytic module of an intact EG51 without a cellulose-binding module. All the enzymes had pH optimum of activity in the acidic range (at pH4.5-6.0), whereas EG25 and EG47 retained 55-60% of the maximum activity at pH 8.5. Substrate specificity of the purified cellulases against carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), β-glucan, Avicel, xylan, xyloglucan, laminarin, and p-nitrophenyl-β-D-cellobioside was studied. EG44 and EG51 were characterized by the highest CMCase activity (59 and 52 U/mg protein). EG28 had the lowest CMCase activity (11 U/mg) amongst the endoglucanases; however, this enzyme displayed the highest activity against β-glucan (125 U/mg). Only EG51 and CBH I were characterized by high adsorption ability on Avicel cellulose (98-99%). Kinetics of Avicel hydrolysis by the isolated cellulases in the presence of purified β-glucosidase from Aspergillus japonicus was studied.

The ability of the Tenascin consensus domain to withstand mutations in the loop regions connecting the b-strands was investigated using alanine scanning mutagenesis demonstrating the potential for randomization in these regions.

In order to elucidate the role of spo0A in differentiation, we performed transcriptional analysis of 824(pMSPOA) (a spo0A-overexpressing C. acetobutylicum strain with enhanced sporulation) against a plasmid control strain. DNA microarray data were contrasted to data from a spo0A knockout strain (SKO1) that neither sporulates nor produces solvents. Transcripts of fatty acid metabolism genes, motility and chemotaxis genes, heat shock protein genes, and genes encoding the Fts family of cell division proteins were differentially expressed in the two strains, suggesting that these genes play roles in sporulation and the solvent stress response. 824(pMSPOA) alone showed significant downregulation of many glycolytic genes in stationary phase, which is consistent with metabolic flux analysis data. Surprisingly, spo0A overexpression resulted in only nominal transcriptional changes of regulatory genes (abrB and sigF) whose expression was significantly altered in SKO1. Overexpression of spo0A imparted increased tolerance and prolonged metabolism in response to butanol stress. While most of the differentially expressed genes appear to be part of a general stress response (similar to patterns in two plasmid control strains and a groESL-overexpressing strain), several genes were expressed at higher levels at early time points after butanol challenge only in 824(pMSPOA). Most of these genes were related to butyryl coenzyme A and butyrate formation and/or assimilation, but they also included the cell division gene ftsX, the gyrase subunit-encoding genes gyrB and gyrA, DNA synthesis and repair genes, and fatty acid synthesis genes, all of which might play a role in the immediate butanol stress response, and thus in enhanced butanol tolerance.",186,"Bacterial Proteins/genetics; Butanols/metabolism; Clostridium/drug effects; Culture Media; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Heat-Shock Response; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Spores, Bacterial/physiology; Transcription Factors/genetics; Transcription, Genetic",Bacterial Proteins; Butanols; Culture Media; Transcription Factors,http://jb.asm.org/content/186/7/1959?related-urls=yesl186/7/1959 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15028679 http://jb.asm.org/cgi/doi/10.1128/JB.186.7.1959-1971.2004 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC374416 http://jb.asm.org/content/186/7/1959.full https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=850799 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15028679 http://jb.asm.org/content/186/7/1959.full.pdf,12,15028679,10.1128/jb.186.7.1959-1971.2004,2166144231,

Frye,"Abstract Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have been one of the most widely used host cells for the manufacture of therapeutic recombinant proteins. An effective and efficient clinical cell line development process, which could quickly identify those rare, high-producing cell lines among a large population of low and non-productive cells, is of considerable interest to speed up biological drug development. In the glutamine synthetase (GS)-CHO expression system, selection of top-producing cell lines is based on controlling the balance between the expression level of GS and the concentration of its specific inhibitor, l -methionine sulfoximine (MSX). The combined amount of GS expressed from plasmids that have been introduced through transfection and the endogenous CHO GS gene determine the stringency and efficiency of selection. Previous studies have shown significant improvement in selection stringency by using GS-knockout CHO cells, which eliminate background GS expression from the endogenous GS gene in CHOK1SV cells. To further improve selection stringency, a series of weakened SV40E promoters have been generated and used to modulate plasmid-based GS expression with the intent of manipulating GS-CHO selection, finely adjusting the balance between GS expression and GS inhibitor (MSX) levels. The reduction of SV40E promoter activities have been confirmed by TaqMan RT-PCR and GFP expression profiling. Significant productivity improvements in both bulk culture and individual clonal cell line have been achieved with the combined use of GS-knockout CHOK1SV cells and weakened SV40E promoters driving GS expression in the current cell line generation process. The selection stringency was significantly increased, as indicated by the shift towards higher distribution of producing-cell populations, even with no MSX added into cell culture medium. The potential applications of weakened SV40E promoter and GS-knockout cells in development of targeted integration and transient CHO expression systems are also discussed.",168,"Animals; CHO Cells/cytology; Cricetinae; Cricetulus; Gene Expression/drug effects; Gene Knockout Techniques; Genetic Vectors; Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase/antagonists & inhibitors; Humans; Methionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis; Simian virus 40/genetics; Transfection",Recombinant Proteins; Methionine Sulfoximine; Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165613003660 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23994266 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165613003660,5,23994266,10.1016/j.jbiotec.2013.08.021,2135849966,

Salvia miltiorrhiza, belonging to the largest and most widely distributed genus in the mint family, is a model medicinal plant with great economic and medicinal value. Diterpenoid tanshinones are the major lipophilic bioactive components in S. miltiorrhiza. Systematic analysis of genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis has not been reported to date. Searching the recently available working draft of the S. miltiorrhiza genome, 40 terpenoid biosynthesis-related genes were identified, of which 27 are novel. These genes are members of 19 families, which encode all of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the universal isoprene precursor isopentenyl diphosphate and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate, and two enzymes associated with the biosynthesis of labdane-related diterpenoids. Through a systematic analysis, it was found that 20 of the 40 genes could be involved in tanshinone biosynthesis. Using a comprehensive approach, the intron/exon structures and expression patterns of all identified genes and their responses to methyl jasmonate treatment were analysed. The conserved domains and phylogenetic relationships among the deduced S. miltiorrhiza proteins and their homologues isolated from other plant species were revealed. It was discovered that some of the key enzymes, such as 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, are encoded by multiple gene members with different expression patterns and subcellular localizations, and both homomeric and heteromeric geranyl diphosphate synthases exist in S. miltiorrhiza. The results suggest the complexity of terpenoid biosynthesis and the existence of metabolic channels for diverse terpenoids in S. miltiorrhiza and provide useful information for improving tanshinone production through genetic engineering.",63,"Biosynthetic Pathways; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genome, Plant; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Plant Proteins/genetics; Salvia miltiorrhiza/classification; Terpenes/metabolism",Plant Proteins; Terpenes,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22291132 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/3346237/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3346237 http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/01/30/jxb.err466.full.pdf+html?frame=sidebar http://paperity.org/p/47290491/genome-wide-identification-and-characterization-of-novel-genes-involved-in-terpenoid https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/63/7/2809/517361 https://doi.org/10.1093%2fjxb%2ferr466 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3346237/,2,22291132,10.1093/jxb/err466,2137244077,PMC3346237

Werner; Andrew Bradbury,"Consensus engineering has been used to increase the stab-ility of a number of different proteins, either by creatingconsensus proteins from scratch or by modifying existingproteins so that their sequences more closely match a con-sensus sequence. In this paper we describe the ﬁrst appli-cation of consensus engineering to the ab initio creation ofa novel ﬂuorescent protein. This was based on the align-ment of 31 ﬂuorescent proteins with >62% homology tomonomeric Azami green (mAG) protein, and usedthe sequence of mAG to guide amino acid selection at pos-itions of ambiguity. This consensus green protein is extre-mely well expressed, monomeric and ﬂuorescent with redshifted absorption and emission characteristics comparedto mAG. Although slightly less stable than mAG, it isbetter expressed and brighter under the excitation con-ditions typically used in single molecule ﬂuorescence spec-troscopy or confocal microscopy. This study illustrates thepower of consensus engineering to create stable proteinsusing the subtle information embedded in the alignment ofsimilar proteins and shows that the beneﬁts of thisapproach may extend beyond stability.Keywords: ﬂuorescent proteins/consensus engineering/Azamigreen/protein stabilityIntroductionConsensus engineering (Steipe et al., 1994; Steipe, 2004) is anapproach to increase the stability of proteins by modifying aprotein sequence so that it more closely resembles a consensusderived from the alignment of numerous proteins of a particu-lar family. This was initially applied to immunoglobulin vari-able domains (Steipe et al., 1994; Ohage and Steipe, 1999;Wirtz and Steipe, 1999), and subsequently to scFvs (Knappiket al., 2000; Visintin et al., 2002; Arndt et al., 2003), scFvfusions (McDonagh et al., 2003), whole antibodies(Whitcomb, 2003)and isolated CH3 domains (Demarest et al.,2004). This has proved particularly helpful in the use of scFvsas intracellular inhibitors of protein function. As antibodies aresecreted proteins, with a large part of their stability conferredby disulﬁde bonds, the reducing environment of the cytoplasmprevents the formation of such disulﬁde bonds, so diminishingcytoplasmic stability and functionality. scFvs which have beenfound to be naturally stable in the cytoplasm tend to havesequences resembling consensus V-region sequences (Visintinet al., 2002), and the mutation of scFvs to sequences closer tothe consensus signiﬁcantly increases their stability, allowingthem to function under reducing conditions (Ohage and Steipe,1999;Wirtz and Steipe, 1999).The use of this concept has notbeen limited to antibody domains, but has also been applied tothe stabilization of GroEL minichaperones (Nikolova et al.,1998; Wang et al., 1999, 2000), WW (Jiang, 2001) and SH3domains (Maxwell, 1998). Recently, a consensus version ofgp120 was designed and expressed for use as a vaccine (Gaoet al., 2005), and although stability data were not reported, itwas extremely well expressed compared to gp120 derivedfrom single parental isolates.A strikingly successful example of consensus engineeringwas the application to phytases (Lehmann et al., 2000a, 2000b,2001, 2002), enzymes used in animal feed technology. In initialexperiments, a consensus sequence based on 13 sequences wasproduced by gene assembly. This showed an increase in stabilityof 228C over the best parental sequence (Lehmann et al.,2000b), which could be increased an additional 30 8C(to90.48C) by eliminating a number of destabilizing mutations andincluding more sequences in the consensus. The ﬁnal consensussequences differed from the closest parental sequences by 18%(80 residues over 444). Unlike other applications of consensusengineering, which tend to be gradualist, with the introductionof mutations in small numbers, the ﬁrst consensus sequence(Lehmann et al., 2000b) in this study was produced using anab initio approach with the gene synthesized directly. Althougha similar approach was used to generate the V genes used in aphage antibody library containing modular consensus frame-works (Knappik et al., 2000), the consensus sequences usedwere relatively similar to the closest individual V genes, andchanges in stability were not studied.The stabilization of proteins is important for improvedhalf-life and function under the adverse conditions encoun-tered in biotechnological and pharmacological applications.It has also been regarded as important in the use of proteinsas scaffolds to generate libraries of speciﬁc binders. It hasbeen reasoned that if the starting scaffold is more stable, itwill be more tolerant to the destabilizing effects ofmutations, or insertions, used to mediate binding. This wasthe rationale used in the creation of the phage antibodylibrary described above. More recently, it has been applied toankyrins. These are widely distributed, soluble repeat pro-teins generally involved in protein–protein interactions, witheach polypeptide repeat composed of 31 amino acids. A con-sensus sequence created by the alignment of over 2000ankyrins was used as a scaffold for diversity by mutation ofspeciﬁc exposed residues within three repeats (Kohl et al.,2003). The high stability of the consensus ankyrin (denatura-tion requires boiling in urea) explains why artiﬁcial ankyrinsselected from these libraries, with Tms of 65–858C (Binzet al., 2003), are more stable than most other scaffolds.Although consensus engineering has not been applied toﬂuorescent proteins, a recent study used gene synthesis torecreate putative ancestral ﬂuorescent proteins (Ugalde et al.,2004;Chang et al., 2005).Three different evolutionary algor-ithms (Yang, 1997) were used, with amino acids, codons or",20,"Amino Acid Sequence; Consensus Sequence; Green Fluorescent Proteins/chemistry; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Protein Engineering; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid",Green Fluorescent Proteins,http://peds.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/2/69.full.pdf https://academic.oup.com/peds/article/20/2/69/2270189 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17277006,8,17277006,10.1093/protein/gzl056,2137612801,

These promoters generally produce high levels of expression in many types of cells and tissues. To generate a library of synthetic promoters capable of generating a range of low, intermediate, and high expression levels, the TATA and CAAT box elements of these promoters were mutated. Other promoter variants were also generated by random mutagenesis. Evaluation using plasmid vectors integrated at a single site in the genome revealed that these various synthetic promoters were capable of expression levels spanning a 40-fold range. Retroviral vectors were equipped with the synthetic promoters and evaluated for their ability to reproduce the graded expression demonstrated by plasmid integration. A vector with a self-inactivating long terminal repeat could neither reproduce the full range of expression levels nor produce stable expression.

Synthetic plasmids bearing the moderately expressed argB gene and the highly expressed, inducible β-galactosidase gene (bgaS) were introduced into fungal cells. Expression of both genes was monitored by Northern hybridization. It was demonstrated that transcription of bgaS is induced and repressed normally, irrespective of whether the gene is integrated into the chromosome or maintained on an extrachromosomal supercoiled plasmid. Transcription of the strongly expressed bgaS gene stimulates transcription of the argB gene located on the same replicating plasmid irrespective of orientation. This effect also occurs with chromosomally integrated vectors, but to a lesser extent. Episomal vectors are present in 10 copies per nucleus, and the expression level of the argB gene is approximately proportional to copy number. However, the amount of mRNA transcribed from the highly expressed bgaS gene on the multi-copy replicating plasmid does not exceed that from single-copy integrants. High levels of expression of the plasmid-borne gene do not affect plasmid mitotic stability or copy number.",253,"Aspergillus nidulans/genetics; Blotting, Northern; DNA Replication; Gene Dosage; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Genes, Fungal; Mitosis; Plasmids; Transcription, Genetic; Transformation, Genetic; beta-Galactosidase/biosynthesis",beta-Galactosidase,http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s004380050318 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs004380050318 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9003309 http://www.uniroma2.it/didattica/VecBio/deposito/07.pdf,10,9003309,10.1007/s004380050318,2065014220,

The nanocolumns were put in motion by the “muscle” of the hydrogel, which swells or contracts depending on the humidity level. This actuation resulted in a fast reversible reorientation of the nanocolumns from tilted to perpendicular to the surface. By further controlling the stress field in the hydrogel, the formation of a variety of elaborate reversibly actuated micropatterns was demonstrated.

We report a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery.",150,"Bacterial Proteins/metabolism; Cell Cycle; Computer Simulation; DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism; Models, Biological; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Mycoplasma genitalium/cytology; Phenotype",Bacterial Proteins; DNA-Binding Proteins,http://www.cell.com/article/S0092867412007763/pdf http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22817898 http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(12)00776-3 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867412007763 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3413483 https://pubpeer.com/publications/A1F446F9B2D0D043572B9CE2A5DB26 https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(12)00776-3 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3413483/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867412007763 https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Whole-Cell-Computational-Model-Predicts-Phenotype-Karr-Sanghvi/f254310f187d7f3d409fdf902d372111a2652de8/figure/0 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81940683.pdf,1,22817898,10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.044,2081781433,PMC3413483

A unique tag sequence is attached to each molecule, and the tagged library is amplified. Unique tagging of the molecules is achieved by sampling a small fraction (1%) of a very large repertoire of tag sequences. The resulting library is hybridized to microbeads that each carry ≈106 strands complementary to one of the tags. About 105 copies of each molecule are collected on each microbead. Because such clones are segregated on microbeads, they can be operated on simultaneously and then assayed separately. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we show how to label and extract microbeads bearing clones differentially expressed between two libraries by using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). Because no prior information about the cloned molecules is required, this process is obviously useful where sequence databases are incomplete or nonexistent. More importantly, the process also permits the isolation of clones that are expressed only in given tissues or that are differentially expressed between normal and diseased states. Such clones then may be spotted on much more cost-effective, tissue- or disease-directed, low-density planar microarrays.",97,"Cloning, Molecular/methods; DNA Probes; DNA, Complementary/isolation & purification; Flow Cytometry; Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects; Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology; Microspheres; Molecular Sequence Data; Nucleic Acid Denaturation; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger/metabolism; Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology; Tumor Cells, Cultured","DNA Probes; DNA, Complementary; Lipopolysaccharides; RNA, Messenger; Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate",http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000PNAS...97.1665B http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC26493 http://www.pnas.org/content/97/4/1665.full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC26493/ http://www.pnas.org/content/97/4/1665.full.pdf,214,10677516,10.1073/pnas.97.4.1665,2120032663,PMC26493

Enzymatic degradation of these polymers has received attention for many years and is becoming a more and more attractive alternative to chemical and mechanical processes. Over the past 15 years, much progress has been made in elucidating the structural characteristics of these polysaccharides and in characterizing the enzymes involved in their degradation and the genes of biotechnologically relevant microorganisms encoding these enzymes. The members of the fungal genus Aspergillus are commonly used for the production of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes. This genus produces a wide spectrum of cell wall-degrading enzymes, allowing not only complete degradation of the polysaccharides but also tailored modifications by using specific enzymes purified from these fungi.

Cohen,"Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) control gene expression by recruiting transcription factors (TFs) and other DNA binding proteins. We aim to understand how individual nucleotides contribute to the function of CREs. Here we introduce CRE analysis by sequencing (CRE-seq), a high-throughput method for producing and testing large numbers of reporter genes in mammalian cells. We used CRE-seq to assay >1,000 single and double nucleotide mutations in a 52-bp CRE in the Rhodopsin promoter that drives strong and specific expression in mammalian photoreceptors. We find that this particular CRE is remarkably complex. The majority (86%) of single nucleotide substitutions in this sequence exert significant effects on regulatory activity. Although changes in the affinity of known TF binding sites explain some of these expression changes, we present evidence for complex phenomena, including binding site turnover and TF competition.

G. J. Van De Winkel; L. K. Ernst; Clark L. Anderson; Ing-Ming Chiu,"Abstract We have isolated, characterized, and sequenced the gene coding for the 72-kDa human high affinity IgG FcR, hFc gamma RI. It consists of six exons and spans 9.4 kilobase pairs. The leader sequence is encoded by two exons, the second of which is 21 base pairs long and contains the predicted site of peptidase cleavage. The third, fourth, and fifth exons each encode homologous Ig-like extracellular domains. The hydrophobic transmembrane region and a highly charged cytoplasmic tail are encoded by a single final exon. The sequence of the 5'-flanking region was determined. Two major transcription initiation sites were identified by RNase protection. The first, more downstream site was confirmed by primer extension studies; canonical CAAT and TATA boxes are located in appropriate positions upstream from this site. The second transcription initiation site was utilized only in RNA from cells incubated with gamma-interferon. This site initiates transcription upstream from the first major site. These data are consistent with the finding of two species of mRNA for hFc gamma RI in myeloid cells that are upregulated when cultured with gamma-interferon. Southern analysis of genomic DNA confirms the restriction map generated from the cloned DNA. One additional HindIII fragment was observed in genomic DNA from 13 randomly selected individuals that was not present in the phage clone used to characterize the gene. This observation suggests the existence of a second hFc gamma RI gene which lacks one of the two internal HindIII sites rather than a restriction fragment length polymorphism.",266,"Amino Acid Sequence; Antigens, CD/genetics; Antigens, Differentiation/genetics; Base Sequence; Blotting, Southern; Cloning, Molecular; DNA/blood; Exons; Genes; Immunoglobulin G/metabolism; Leukocytes/immunology; Molecular Sequence Data; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Receptors, Fc/genetics; Receptors, IgG; Restriction Mapping","Antigens, CD; Antigens, Differentiation; Immunoglobulin G; Receptors, Fc; Receptors, IgG; DNA",http://www.jbc.org/content/266/20/13449.abstract?266/20/13449 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1830050 http://www.jbc.org/content/266/20/13449.full.pdf,6,1830050,,1545193508,

Klagge; Stuart G. Siddell,"Coronavirus genomes are the largest known autonomously replicating RNAs with a size of ca. 30 kb. They are of positive polarity and are translated to produce the viral proteins needed for the assembly of an active replicase-transcriptase complex. In addition to replicating the genomic RNA, a key feature of this complex is a unique transcription process that results in the synthesis of a nested set of six to eight subgenomic mRNAs. These subgenomic mRNAs are produced in constant but nonequimolar amounts and, in general, each is translated to produce a single protein. To take advantage of these features, we have developed a multigene expression vector based on human coronavirus 229E. We have constructed a prototype RNA vector containing the 5' and 3' ends of the human coronavirus genome, the entire human coronavirus replicase gene, and three reporter genes (i.e., the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase [CAT] gene, the firefly luciferase [LUC] gene, and the green fluorescent protein [GFP] gene). Each reporter gene is located downstream of a human coronavirus transcription-associated sequence, which is required for the synthesis of individual subgenomic mRNAs. The transfection of vector RNA and human coronavirus nucleocapsid protein mRNA into BHK-21 cells resulted in the expression of the CAT, LUC, and GFP reporter proteins. Sequence analysis confirmed the synthesis of coronavirus-specific mRNAs encoding CAT, LUC, and GFP. In addition, we have shown that human coronavirus-based vector RNA can be packaged into virus-like particles that, in turn, can be used to transduce immature and mature human dendritic cells. In summary, we describe a new class of eukaryotic, multigene expression vectors that are based on the human coronavirus 229E and have the ability to transduce human dendritic cells.",77,"Animals; Coronavirus/genetics; Cricetinae; Dendritic Cells/immunology; Genetic Vectors/genetics; Humans; Immunotherapy; Multigene Family; RNA, Viral/genetics; Transcription, Genetic; Transduction, Genetic; Transfection; Virus Assembly","RNA, Viral",http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/12941887 http://jvi.asm.org/content/77/18/9790.abstract?maxtoshow=R77/18/9790 http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/64841/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC224574 http://jvi.asm.org/content/77/18/9790.full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC224574/ http://jvi.asm.org/content/77/18/9790.full.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ingo_Klagge/publication/10594803_Multigene_RNA_Vector_Based_on_Coronavirus_Transcription/links/0c960522f39b1e2925000000.pdf,1,12941887,10.1128/jvi.77.18.9790-9798.2003,2025873654,PMC224574

Comparing the molecular properties of homologous proteins from thermophilic and mesophilic bacteria is important for understanding the mechanisms of microbial adaptation to extreme environments. The thermophile Thermoanaerobacter (Thermoanaerobium) brockii and the mesophile Clostridium beijerinckii contain an NADP(H)-linked, zinc-containing secondary alcohol dehydrogenase (TBADH and CBADH) showing a similarly broad substrate range. The structural genes encoding the TBADH and the CBADH were cloned, sequenced, and highly expressed in Escherichia coli . The coding sequences of the TB adh and the CB adh genes are, respectively, 1056 and 1053 nucleotides long. The TB adh gene encoded an amino acid sequence identical to that of the purified TBADH. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of the TB and CB adh genes showed a 76% identity and a 86% similarity, and the two genes had a similar preference for codons with A or T in the third position. Multiple sequence alignment of ADHs from different sources revealed that two (Cys-46 and His-67) of the three ligands for the catalytic Zn atom of the horse-liver ADH are preserved in TBADH and CBADH. Both the TBADH and CBADH were homotetramers. The substrate specificities and thermostabilities of the TBADH and CBADH expressed in E. coli were identical to those of the enzymes isolated from T. brockii and C. beijerinckii , respectively. A comparison of the amino acid composition of the two ADHs suggests that the presence of eight additional proline residues in TBADH than in CBADH and the exchange of hydrophilic and large hydrophobic residues in CBADH for the small hydrophobic amino acids Pro, Ala, and Val in TBADH might contribute to the higher thermostability of the T. brockii enzyme.",3,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16887600 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1075996497900834#!,18,16887600,10.1006/anae.1997.0083,1999147504,

B. Rudolph,"The enzymes beta-hydroxybutyryl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase (BHBD), crotonase, and butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (BCD) from Clostridium acetobutylicum are responsible for the formation of butyryl-CoA from acetoacetyl-CoA. These enzymes are essential to both acid formation and solvent formation by clostridia. Clustered genes encoding BHBD, crotonase, BCD, and putative electron transfer flavoprotein alpha and beta subunits have been cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the crt gene indicates that it encodes crotonase, a protein with 261 amino acid residues and a calculated molecular mass of 28.2 kDa; the hbd gene encodes BHBD, with 282 residues and a molecular mass of 30.5 kDa. Three open reading frames (bcd, etfB, and etfA) are located between crt and hbd. The nucleotide sequence of bcd indicates that it encodes BCD, which consists of 379 amino acid residues and has high levels of homology with various acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Open reading frames etfB and etfA, located downstream of bcd, encode 27.2- and 36.1-kDa proteins, respectively, and show homology with the fixAB genes and the alpha and beta subunits of the electron transfer flavoprotein. These findings suggest that BCD in clostridia might interact with the electron transfer flavoprotein in its redox function. Primer extension analysis identified a promoter consensus sequence upstream of the crt gene, suggesting that the clustered genes are transcribed as a transcriptional unit and form a BCS (butyryl-CoA synthesis) operon. A DNA fragment containing the entire BCS operon was subcloned into an Escherichia coli-C. acetobutylicum shuttle vector. Enzyme activity assays showed that crotonase and BHBD were highly overproduced in cell extracts from E. coli harboring the subclone.
